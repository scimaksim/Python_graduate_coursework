chapter vii  oliver continues refractory  noah claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace and paused not once for breath until he reached the workhousegate having rested here for a minute or so to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show of tears and terror he knocked loudly at the wicket and presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it that even he who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times started back in astonishment  why whats the matter with the boy said the old pauper  mr bumble  mr bumble cried noah with wellaffected dismay and in tones so loud and agitated that they not only caught the ear of mr bumble himself who happened to be hard by but alarmed him so much that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hatwhich is a very curious and remarkable circumstance as showing that even a beadle acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse may be afflicted with a momentary visitation of loss of selfpossession and forgetfulness of personal dignity  oh mr bumble sir said noah  oliver siroliver has  what  what interposed mr bumble with a gleam of pleasure in his metallic eyes not run away he hasnt run away has he noah  no sir no  not run away sir but hes turned wicious replied noah he tried to murder me sir and then he tried to murder charlotte and then missis  oh what dreadful pain it is  such agony please sir  and here noah writhed and twisted his body into an extensive variety of eellike positions thereby giving mr bumble to understand that from the violent and sanguinary onset of oliver twist he had sustained severe internal injury and damage from which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture  when noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed mr bumble he imparted additional effect thereunto by bewailing his dreadful wounds ten times louder than before and when he observed a gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard he was more tragic in his lamentations than ever rightly conceiving it highly expedient to attract the notice and rouse the indignation of the gentleman aforesaid  the gentlemans notice was very soon attracted for he had not walked three paces when he turned angrily round and inquired what that young cur was howling for and why mr bumble did not favour him with something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated an involuntary process  its a poor boy from the freeschool sir replied mr bumble who has been nearly murderedall but murdered sirby young twist  by jove exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat stopping short  i knew it  i felt a strange presentiment from the very first that that audacious young savage would come to be hung  he has likewise attempted sir to murder the female servant said mr bumble with a face of ashy paleness  and his missis interposed mr claypole  and his master too i think you said noah added mr bumble  no hes out or he would have murdered him replied noah he said he wanted to  ah  said he wanted to did he my boy inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat  yes sir replied noah  and please sir missis wants to know whether mr bumble can spare time to step up there directly and flog himcause masters out  certainly my boy certainly said the gentleman in the white waistcoat smiling benignly and patting noahs head which was about three inches higher than his own  youre a good boya very good boy heres a penny for you  bumble just step up to sowerberrys with your cane and see whats best to be done dont spare him bumble  no i will not sir replied the beadle  and the cocked hat and cane having been by this time adjusted to their owners satisfaction mr bumble and noah claypole betook themselves with all speed to the undertakers shop  here the position of affairs had not at all improved  sowerberry had not yet returned and oliver continued to kick with undiminished vigour at the cellardoor  the accounts of his ferocity as related by mrs sowerberry and charlotte were of so startling a nature that mr bumble judged it prudent to parley before opening the door  with this view he gave a kick at the outside by way of prelude and then applying his mouth to the keyhole said in a deep and impressive tone  oliver  come you let me out replied oliver from the inside  do you know this here voice oliver said mr bumble  yes replied oliver  aint you afraid of it sir  aint you atrembling while i speak sir said mr bumble  no replied oliver boldly  an answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit and was in the habit of receiving staggered mr bumble not a little  he stepped back from the keyhole drew himself up to his full height and looked from one to another of the three bystanders in mute astonishment  oh you know mr bumble he must be mad said mrs sowerberry  no boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you  its not madness maam replied mr bumble after a few moments of deep meditation  its meat  what exclaimed mrs sowerberry  meat maam meat replied bumble with stern emphasis youve overfed him maam  youve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him maam unbecoming a person of his condition as the board mrs sowerberry who are practical philosophers will tell you  what have paupers to do with soul or spirit  its quite enough that we let em have live bodies  if you had kept the boy on gruel maam this would never have happened  dear dear ejaculated mrs sowerberry piously raising her eyes to the kitchen ceiling this comes of being liberal  the liberality of mrs sowerberry to oliver had consisted of a profuse bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would eat so there was a great deal of meekness and selfdevotion in her voluntarily remaining under mr bumbles heavy accusation  of which to do her justice she was wholly innocent in thought word or deed  ah said mr bumble when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again the only thing that can be done now that i know of is to leave him in the cellar for a day or so till hes a little starved down and then to take him out and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship  he comes of a bad family excitable natures mrs sowerberry  both the nurse and doctor said that that mother of his made her way here against difficulties and pain that would have killed any welldisposed woman weeks before  at this point of mr bumbles discourse oliver just hearing enough to know that some allusion was being made to his mother recommenced kicking with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible sowerberry returned at this juncture  olivers offence having been explained to him with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his ire he unlocked the cellardoor in a twinkling and dragged his rebellious apprentice out by the collar  olivers clothes had been torn in the beating he had received his face was bruised and scratched and his hair scattered over his forehead the angry flush had not disappeared however and when he was pulled out of his prison he scowled boldly on noah and looked quite undismayed  now you are a nice young fellow aint you said sowerberry giving oliver a shake and a box on the ear  he called my mother names replied oliver  well and what if he did you little ungrateful wretch said mrs sowerberry  she deserved what he said and worse  she didnt said oliver  she did said mrs sowerberry  its a lie said oliver  mrs sowerberry burst into a flood of tears  this flood of tears left mr sowerberry no alternative  if he had hesitated for one instant to punish oliver most severely it must be quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established a brute an unnatural husband an insulting creature a base imitation of a man and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of this chapter  to do him justice he was as far as his power wentit was not very extensivekindly disposed towards the boy perhaps because it was his interest to be so perhaps because his wife disliked him the flood of tears however left him no resource so he at once gave him a drubbing which satisfied even mrs sowerberry herself and rendered mr bumbles subsequent application of the parochial cane rather unnecessary  for the rest of the day he was shut up in the back kitchen in company with a pump and a slice of bread and at night mrs sowerberry after making various remarks outside the door by no means complimentary to the memory of his mother looked into the room and amidst the jeers and pointings of noah and charlotte ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed  it was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the gloomy workshop of the undertaker that oliver gave way to the feelings which the days treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a mere child  he had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt he had borne the lash without a cry for he felt that pride swelling in his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last though they had roasted him alive  but now when there were none to see or hear him he fell upon his knees on the floor and hiding his face in his hands wept such tears as god send for the credit of our nature few so young may ever have cause to pour out before him  for a long time oliver remained motionless in this attitude the candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet having gazed cautiously round him and listened intently he gently undid the fastenings of the door and looked abroad  it was a cold dark night  the stars seemed to the boys eyes farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before there was no wind and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground looked sepulchral and deathlike from being so still he softly reclosed the door  having availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had sat himself down upon a bench to wait for morning  with the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the shutters oliver arose and again unbarred the door  one timid look aroundone moments pause of hesitationhe had closed it behind him and was in the open street  he looked to the right and to the left uncertain whither to fly  he remembered to have seen the waggons as they went out toiling up the hill  he took the same route and arriving at a footpath across the fields which he knew after some distance led out again into the road struck into it and walked quickly on  along this same footpath oliver wellremembered he had trotted beside mr bumble when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm his way lay directly in front of the cottage his heart beat quickly when he bethought himself of this and he half resolved to turn back he had come a long way though and should lose a great deal of time by doing so  besides it was so early that there was very little fear of his being seen so he walked on  he reached the house  there was no appearance of its inmates stirring at that early hour  oliver stopped and peeped into the garden  a child was weeding one of the little beds as he stopped he raised his pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions oliver felt glad to see him before he went for though younger than himself he had been his little friend and playmate  they had been beaten and starved and shut up together many and many a time  hush dick said oliver as the boy ran to the gate and thrust his thin arm between the rails to greet him  is any one up  nobody but me replied the child  you musnt say you saw me dick said oliver  i am running away they beat and illuse me dick and i am going to seek my fortune some long way off  i dont know where  how pale you are  i heard the doctor tell them i was dying replied the child with a faint smile  i am very glad to see you dear but dont stop dont stop  yes yes i will to say goodbye to you replied oliver i shall see you again dick  i know i shall  you will be well and happy  i hope so replied the child  after i am dead but not before  i know the doctor must be right oliver because i dream so much of heaven and angels and kind faces that i never see when i am awake kiss me said the child  climbing up the low gate and flinging his little arms round olivers neck goodbye dear  god bless you  the blessing was from a young childs lips but it was the first that oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head and through the struggles and sufferings and troubles and changes of his after life he never once forgot it
