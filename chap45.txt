chapter xliii  wherein is shown how the artful dodger got into trouble  and so it was you that was your own friend was it asked mr claypole otherwise bolter when by virtue of the compact entered into between them he had removed next day to fagins house  cod i thought as much last night  every mans his own friend my dear replied fagin with his most insinuating grin  he hasnt as good a one as himself anywhere  except sometimes replied morris bolter assuming the air of a man of the world  some people are nobodys enemies but their own yer know  dont believe that said fagin  when a mans his own enemy its only because hes too much his own friend not because hes careful for everybody but himself  pooh pooh  there aint such a thing in nature  there oughnt to be if there is replied mr bolter  that stands to reason  some conjurers say that number three is the magic number and some say number seven  its neither my friend neither  its number one  ha ha cried mr bolter  number one for ever  in a little community like ours my dear said fagin who felt it necessary to qualify this position we have a general number one without considering me too as the same and all the other young people  oh the devil exclaimed mr bolter  you see pursued fagin affecting to disregard this interruption we are so mixed up together and identified in our interests that it must be so  for instance its your object to take care of number onemeaning yourself  certainly replied mr bolter  yer about right there  well  you cant take care of yourself number one without taking care of me number one  number two you mean said mr bolter who was largely endowed with the quality of selfishness  no i dont retorted fagin  im of the same importance to you as you are to yourself  i say interrupted mr bolter yer a very nice man and im very fond of yer but we aint quite so thick together as all that comes to  only think said fagin shrugging his shoulders and stretching out his hands only consider  youve done whats a very pretty thing and what i love you for doing but what at the same time would put the cravat round your throat thats so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloosein plain english the halter  mr bolter put his hand to his neckerchief as if he felt it inconveniently tight and murmured an assent qualified in tone but not in substance  the gallows continued fagin the gallows my dear is an ugly fingerpost which points out a very short and sharp turning that has stopped many a bold fellows career on the broad highway  to keep in the easy road and keep it at a distance is object number one with you  of course it is replied mr bolter  what do yer talk about such things for  only to show you my meaning clearly said the jew raising his eyebrows  to be able to do that you depend upon me to keep my little business all snug i depend upon you the first is your number one the second my number one  the more you value your number one the more careful you must be of mine so we come at last to what i told you at firstthat a regard for number one holds us all together and must do so unless we would all go to pieces in company  thats true rejoined mr bolter thoughtfully  oh yer a cunning old codger  mr fagin saw with delight that this tribute to his powers was no mere compliment but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of his wily genius which it was most important that he should entertain in the outset of their acquaintance  to strengthen an impression so desirable and useful he followed up the blow by acquainting him in some detail with the magnitude and extent of his operations blending truth and fiction together as best served his purpose and bringing both to bear with so much art that mr bolters respect visibly increased and became tempered at the same time with a degree of wholesome fear which it was highly desirable to awaken  its this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy losses said fagin  my best hand was taken from me yesterday morning  you dont mean to say he died cried mr bolter  no no replied fagin not so bad as that  not quite so bad  what i suppose he was  wanted interposed fagin  yes he was wanted  very particular inquired mr bolter  no replied fagin not very  he was charged with attempting to pick a pocket and they found a silver snuffbox on himhis own my dear his own for he took snuff himself and was very fond of it  they remanded him till today for they thought they knew the owner  ah he was worth fifty boxes and id give the price of as many to have him back  you should have known the dodger my dear you should have known the dodger  well but i shall know him i hope dont yer think so said mr bolter  im doubtful about it replied fagin with a sigh  if they dont get any fresh evidence itll only be a summary conviction and we shall have him back again after six weeks or so but if they do its a case of lagging  they know what a clever lad he is hell be a lifer  theyll make the artful nothing less than a lifer  what do you mean by lagging and a lifer demanded mr bolter whats the good of talking in that way to me why dont yer speak so as i can understand yer  fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar tongue and being interpreted mr bolter would have been informed that they represented that combination of words transportation for life when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of master bates with his hands in his breechespockets and his face twisted into a look of semicomical woe  its all up fagin said charley when he and his new companion had been made known to each other  what do you mean  theyve found the gentleman as owns the box two or three mores a coming to dentify him and the artfuls booked for a passage out replied master bates  i must have a full suit of mourning fagin and a hatband to wisit him in afore he sets out upon his travels  to think of jack dawkinslummy jackthe dodgerthe artful dodgergoing abroad for a common twopennyhalfpenny sneezebox  i never thought hed a done it under a gold watch chain and seals at the lowest oh why didnt he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables and go out as a gentleman and not like a common prig without no honour nor glory  with this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend master bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and despondency  what do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for exclaimed fagin darting an angry look at his pupil wasnt he always the topsawyer among you all  is there one of you that could touch him or come near him on any scent  eh  not one replied master bates in a voice rendered husky by regret not one  then what do you talk of replied fagin angrily what are you blubbering for  cause it isnt on the record is it said charley chafed into perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets cause it cant come out in the dictment cause nobody will never know half of what he was  how will he stand in the newgate calendar praps not be there at all  oh my eye my eye wot a blow it is  ha ha cried fagin extending his right hand and turning to mr bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy see what a pride they take in their profession my dear  aint it beautiful  mr bolter nodded assent and fagin after contemplating the grief of charley bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction stepped up to that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder  never mind charley said fagin soothingly itll come out itll be sure to come out  theyll all know what a clever fellow he was hell show it himself and not disgrace his old pals and teachers  think how young he is too  what a distinction charley to be lagged at his time of life  well it is a honour that is said charley a little consoled  he shall have all he wants continued the jew  he shall be kept in the stone jug charley like a gentleman  like a gentleman  with his beer every day and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with if he cant spend it  no shall he though cried charley bates  ay that he shall replied fagin and well have a bigwig charley one thats got the greatest gift of the gab  to carry on his defence and he shall make a speech for himself too if he likes and well read it all in the papersartful dodgershrieks of laughterhere the court was convulsedeh charley eh  ha ha laughed master bates what a lark that would be wouldnt it fagin  i say how the artful would bother em wouldnt he  would cried fagin  he shallhe will  ah to be sure so he will repeated charley rubbing his hands  i think i see him now cried the jew bending his eyes upon his pupil  so do i cried charley bates  ha ha ha so do i  i see it all afore me upon my soul i do fagin  what a game  what a regular game all the bigwigs trying to look solemn and jack dawkins addressing of em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judges own son making a speech arter dinnerha ha ha  in fact mr fagin had so well humoured his young friends eccentric disposition that master bates who had at first been disposed to consider the imprisoned dodger rather in the light of a victim now looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities  we must know how he gets on today by some handy means or other said fagin  let me think  shall i go asked charley  not for the world replied fagin  are you mad my dear stark mad that youd walk into the very place whereno charley no one is enough to lose at a time  you dont mean to go yourself i suppose said charley with a humorous leer  that wouldnt quite fit replied fagin shaking his head  then why dont you send this new cove asked master bates laying his hand on noahs arm  nobody knows him  why if he didnt mind observed fagin  mind interposed charley  what should he have to mind  really nothing my dear said fagin turning to mr bolter really nothing  oh i dare say about that yer know observed noah backing towards the door and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm  no nonone of that  its not in my department that aint  wot department has he got fagin inquired master bates surveying noahs lank form with much disgust  the cutting away when theres anything wrong and the eating all the wittles when theres everything right is that his branch  never mind retorted mr bolter and dont yer take liberties with yer superiors little boy or yerll find yerself in the wrong shop  master bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat that it was some time before fagin could interpose and represent to mr bolter that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the policeoffice that inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged nor any description of his person had yet been forwarded to the metropolis it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to it for shelter and that if he were properly disguised it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in london inasmuch as it would be of all places the very last to which he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will  persuaded in part by these representations but overborne in a much greater degree by his fear of fagin mr bolter at length consented with a very bad grace to undertake the expedition by fagins directions he immediately substituted for his own attire a waggoners frock velveteen breeches and leather leggings  all of which articles the jew had at hand  he was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike tickets and a carters whip  thus equipped he was to saunter into the office as some country fellow from covent garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his curiousity and as he was as awkward ungainly and rawboned a fellow as need be mr fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to perfection  these arrangements completed he was informed of the necessary signs and tokens by which to recognise the artful dodger and was conveyed by master bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of bow street having described the precise situation of the office and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the passage and when he got into the side and pull off his hat as he went into the room charley bates bade him hurry on alone and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting  noah claypole or morris bolter as the reader pleases punctually followed the directions he had received whichmaster bates being pretty well acquainted with the localitywere so exact that he was enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question or meeting with any interruption by the way  he found himself jostled among a crowd of people chiefly women who were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room at the upper end of which was a raised platform railed off from the rest with a dock for the prisoners on the left hand against the wall a box for the witnesses in the middle and a desk for the magistrates on the right the awful locality last named being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the common gaze and left the vulgar to imagine if they could the full majesty of justice  there were only a couple of women in the dock who were nodding to their admiring friends while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table  a jailer stood reclining against the dockrail tapping his nose listlessly with a large key except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation among the idlers by proclaiming silence or looked sternly up to bid some woman take that baby out when the gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries halfsmothered in the mothers shawl from some meagre infant  the room smelt close and unwholesome the walls were dirtdiscoloured and the ceiling blackened  there was an old smoky bust over the mantelshelf and a dusty clock above the dockthe only thing present that seemed to go on as it ought for depravity or poverty or an habitual acquaintance with both had left a taint on all the animate matter hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that frowned upon it  noah looked eagerly about him for the dodger but although there were several women who would have done very well for that distinguished characters mother or sister and more than one man who might be supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father nobody at all answering the description given him of mr dawkins was to be seen  he waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women being committed for trial went flaunting out and then was quickly relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object of his visit  it was indeed mr dawkins who shuffling into the office with the big coat sleeves tucked up as usual his left hand in his pocket and his hat in his right hand preceded the jailer with a rolling gait altogether indescribable and taking his place in the dock requested in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that ere disgraceful sitivation for  hold your tongue will you said the jailer  im an englishman aint i rejoined the dodger  where are my priwileges  youll get your privileges soon enough retorted the jailer and pepper with em  well see wot the secretary of state for the home affairs has got to say to the beaks if i dont replied mr dawkins  now then  wot is this here business  i shall thank the madgstrates to dispose of this here little affair and not to keep me while they read the paper for ive got an appointment with a genelman in the city and as i am a man of my word and wery punctual in business matters hell go away if i aint there to my time and then praps ther wont be an action for damage against them as kep me away  oh no certainly not  at this point the dodger with a show of being very particular with a view to proceedings to be had thereafter desired the jailer to communicate the names of them two files as was on the bench  which so tickled the spectators that they laughed almost as heartily as master bates could have done if he had heard the request  silence there cried the jailer  what is this inquired one of the magistrates  a pickpocketing case your worship  has the boy ever been here before  he ought to have been a many times replied the jailer he has been pretty well everywhere else  i know him well your worship  oh you know me do you cried the artful making a note of the statement  wery good  thats a case of deformation of character any way  here there was another laugh and another cry of silence  now then where are the witnesses said the clerk  ah thats right added the dodger  where are they  i should like to see em  this wish was immediately gratified for a policeman stepped forward who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a crowd and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom which being a very old one he deliberately put back again after trying it on his own countenance  for this reason he took the dodger into custody as soon as he could get near him and the said dodger being searched had upon his person a silver snuffbox with the owners name engraved upon the lid  this gentleman had been discovered on reference to the court guide and being then and there present swore that the snuffbox was his and that he had missed it on the previous day the moment he had disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to  he had also remarked a young gentleman in the throng particularly active in making his way about and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him  have you anything to ask this witness boy said the magistrate  i wouldnt abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him replied the dodger  have you anything to say at all  do you hear his worship ask if youve anything to say inquired the jailer nudging the silent dodger with his elbow  i beg your pardon said the dodger looking up with an air of abstraction  did you redress yourself to me my man  i never see such an outandout young wagabond your worship observed the officer with a grin  do you mean to say anything you young shaver  no replied the dodger not here for this aint the shop for justice  besides which my attorney is abreakfasting this morning with the wice president of the house of commons but i shall have something to say elsewhere and so will he and so will a wery numerous and spectable circle of acquaintance asll make them beaks wish theyd never been born or that theyd got their footmen to hang em up to their own hatpegs afore they let em come out this morning to try it on upon me  ill  there  hes fully committed interposed the clerk take him away  come on said the jailer  oh ah  ill come on replied the dodger brushing his hat with the palm of his hand  ah to the bench its no use your looking frightened i wont show you no mercy not a haporth of it  youll pay for this my fine fellers  i wouldnt be you for something  i wouldnt go free now if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me  here carry me off to prison  take me away  with these last words the dodger suffered himself to be led off by the collar threatening till he got into the yard to make a parliamentary business of it and then grinning in the officers face with great glee and selfapproval  having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell noah made the best of his way back to where he had left master bates after waiting here some time he was joined by that young gentleman who had prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug retreat and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any impertinent person  the two hastened back together to bear to mr fagin the animating news that the dodger was doing full justice to his bringingup and establishing for himself a glorious reputation
