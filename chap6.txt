chapter vi  oliver being goaded by the taunts of noah rouses into action and rather astonishes him  the months trial over oliver was formally apprenticed  it was a nice sickly season just at this time  in commercial phrase coffins were looking up and in the course of a few weeks oliver acquired a great deal of experience  the success of mr sowerberrys ingenious speculation exceeded even his most sanguine hopes  the oldest inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so prevalent or so fatal to infant existence and many were the mournful processions which little oliver headed in a hatband reaching down to his knees to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town  as oliver accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too in order that he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a finished undertaker he had many opportunities of observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strongminded people bear their trials and losses  for instance when sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old lady or gentleman who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and nieces who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public occasions they would be as happy among themselves as need bequite cheerful and contentedconversing together with as much freedom and gaiety as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them  husbands too bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness wives again put on weeds for their husbands as if so far from grieving in the garb of sorrow they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and attractive as possible  it was observable too that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment recovered almost as soon as they reached home and became quite composed before the teadrinking was over  all this was very pleasant and improving to see and oliver beheld it with great admiration  that oliver twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good people i cannot although i am his biographer undertake to affirm with any degree of confidence but i can most distinctly say that for many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and illtreatment of noah claypole who used him far worse than before now that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and hatband while he the old one remained stationary in the muffincap and leathers  charlotte treated him ill because noah did and mrs sowerberry was his decided enemy because mr sowerberry was disposed to be his friend so between these three on one side and a glut of funerals on the other oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was when he was shut up by mistake in the grain department of a brewery  and now i come to a very important passage in olivers history for i have to record an act slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects and proceedings  one day oliver and noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual dinnerhour to banquet upon a small joint of muttona pound and a half of the worst end of the neckwhen charlotte being called out of the way there ensued a brief interval of time which noah claypole being hungry and vicious considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young oliver twist  intent upon this innocent amusement noah put his feet on the tablecloth and pulled olivers hair and twitched his ears and expressed his opinion that he was a sneak and furthermore announced his intention of coming to see him hanged whenever that desirable event should take place and entered upon various topics of petty annoyance like a malicious and illconditioned charityboy as he was but making oliver cry noah attempted to be more facetious still and in his attempt did what many sometimes do to this day when they want to be funny  he got rather personal  workus said noah hows your mother  shes dead replied oliver dont you say anything about her to me  olivers colour rose as he said this he breathed quickly and there was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils which mr claypole thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying under this impression he returned to the charge  what did she die of workus said noah  of a broken heart some of our old nurses told me replied oliver more as if he were talking to himself than answering noah i think i know what it must be to die of that  tol de rol lol lol right fol lairy workus said noah as a tear rolled down olivers cheek  whats set you a snivelling now  not you replied oliver sharply there thats enough dont say anything more to me about her youd better not  better not exclaimed noah well  better not  workus dont be impudent  your mother too  she was a nice un she was  oh lor and here noah nodded his head expressively and curled up as much of his small red nose as muscular action could collect together for the occasion  yer know workus continued noah emboldened by olivers silence and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity of all tones the most annoying yer know workus it cant be helped now and of course yer couldnt help it then and i am very sorry for it and im sure we all are and pity yer very much  but yer must know workus yer mother was a regular rightdown bad un  what did you say inquired oliver looking up very quickly  a regular rightdown bad un workus replied noah coolly and its a great deal better workus that she died when she did or else shed have been hard labouring in bridewell or transported or hung which is more likely than either isnt it  crimson with fury oliver started up overthrew the chair and table seized noah by the throat shook him in the violence of his rage till his teeth chattered in his head and collecting his whole force into one heavy blow felled him to the ground  a minute ago the boy had looked the quiet child mild dejected creature that harsh treatment had made him  but his spirit was roused at last the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire his breast heaved his attitude was erect his eye bright and vivid his whole person changed as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet and defied him with an energy he had never known before  hell murder me blubbered noah  charlotte  missis  heres the new boy a murdering of me  help help  olivers gone mad charlotte  noahs shouts were responded to by a loud scream from charlotte and a louder from mrs sowerberry the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by a sidedoor while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life to come further down  oh you little wretch screamed charlotte seizing oliver with her utmost force which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in particularly good training  oh you little ungrateful murderous horrid villain  and between every syllable charlotte gave oliver a blow with all her might accompanying it with a scream for the benefit of society  charlottes fist was by no means a light one but lest it should not be effectual in calming olivers wrath mrs sowerberry plunged into the kitchen and assisted to hold him with one hand while she scratched his face with the other in this favourable position of affairs noah rose from the ground and pommelled him behind  this was rather too violent exercise to last long  when they were all wearied out and could tear and beat no longer they dragged oliver struggling and shouting but nothing daunted into the dustcellar and there locked him up  this being done mrs sowerberry sunk into a chair and burst into tears  bless her shes going off said charlotte  a glass of water noah dear  make haste  oh  charlotte said mrs sowerberry  speaking as well as she could through a deficiency of breath and a sufficiency of cold water which noah had poured over her head and shoulders  oh charlotte what a mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds  ah mercy indeed maam was the reply  i only hope thisll teach master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures that are born to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle poor noah  he was all but killed maam when i come in  poor fellow said mrs sowerberry looking piteously on the charityboy  noah whose top waistcoatbutton might have been somewhere on a level with the crown of olivers head rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him and performed some affecting tears and sniffs  whats to be done exclaimed mrs sowerberry  your masters not at home theres not a man in the house and hell kick that door down in ten minutes  olivers vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question rendered this occurance highly probable  dear dear  i dont know maam said charlotte unless we send for the policeofficers  or the millingtary suggested mr claypole  no no said mrs sowerberry bethinking herself of olivers old friend  run to mr bumble noah and tell him to come here directly and not to lose a minute never mind your cap  make haste  you can hold a knife to that black eye as you run along itll keep the swelling down  noah stopped to make no reply but started off at his fullest speed and very much it astonished the people who were out walking to see a charityboy tearing through the streets pellmell with no cap on his head and a claspknife at his eye
