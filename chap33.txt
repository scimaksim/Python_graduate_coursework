chapter xxxi  involves a critical position  whos that inquired brittles opening the door a little way with the chain up and peeping out shading the candle with his hand  open the door replied a man outside its the officers from bow street as was sent to today  much comforted by this assurance brittles opened the door to its full width and confronted a portly man in a greatcoat who walked in without saying anything more and wiped his shoes on the mat as coolly as if he lived there  just send somebody out to relieve my mate will you young man said the officer hes in the gig aminding the prad  have you got a coach us here that you could put it up in for five or ten minutes  brittles replying in the affirmative and pointing out the building the portly man stepped back to the gardengate and helped his companion to put up the gig  while brittles lighted them in a state of great admiration  this done they returned to the house and being shown into a parlour took off their greatcoats and hats and showed like what they were  the man who had knocked at the door was a stout personage of middle height aged about fifty with shiny black hair cropped pretty close halfwhiskers a round face and sharp eyes  the other was a redheaded bony man in topboots with a rather illfavoured countenance and a turnedup sinisterlooking nose  tell your governor that blathers and duff is here will you said the stouter man smoothing down his hair and laying a pair of handcuffs on the table  oh  goodevening master  can i have a word or two with you in private if you please  this was addressed to mr losberne who now made his appearance that gentleman motioning brittles to retire brought in the two ladies and shut the door  this is the lady of the house said mr losberne motioning towards mrs maylie  mr blathers made a bow  being desired to sit down he put his hat on the floor and taking a chair motioned to duff to do the same  the latter gentleman who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society or quite so much at his ease in itone of the twoseated himself after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs and the head of his stick into his mouth with some embarrassment  now with regard to this here robbery master said blathers what are the circumstances  mr losberne who appeared desirous of gaining time recounted them at great length and with much circumlocution  messrs blathers and duff looked very knowing meanwhile and occasionally exchanged a nod  i cant say for certain till i see the work of course said blathers but my opinion at once isi dont mind committing myself to that extentthat this wasnt done by a yokel eh duff  certainly not replied duff  and translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies i apprehend your meaning to be that this attempt was not made by a countryman said mr losberne with a smile  thats it master replied blathers  this is all about the robbery is it  all replied the doctor  now what is this about this here boy that the servants are atalking on said blathers  nothing at all replied the doctor  one of the frightened servants chose to take it into his head that he had something to do with this attempt to break into the house but its nonsense sheer absurdity  wery easy disposed of if it is remarked duff  what he says is quite correct observed blathers nodding his head in a confirmatory way and playing carelessly with the handcuffs as if they were a pair of castanets  who is the boy what account does he give of himself  where did he come from he didnt drop out of the clouds did he master  of course not replied the doctor with a nervous glance at the two ladies  i know his whole history but we can talk about that presently  you would like first to see the place where the thieves made their attempt i suppose  certainly rejoined mr blathers  we had better inspect the premises first and examine the servants afterwards thats the usual way of doing business  lights were then procured and messrs blathers and duff attended by the native constable brittles giles and everybody else in short went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window and afterwards went round by way of the lawn and looked in at the window and after that had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with and after that a lantern to trace the footsteps with and after that a pitchfork to poke the bushes with  this done amidst the breathless interest of all beholders they came in again and mr giles and brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the previous nights adventures which they performed some six times over contradicting each other in not more than one important respect the first time and in not more than a dozen the last  this consummation being arrived at blathers and duff cleared the room and held a long council together compared with which for secrecy and solemnity a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine would be mere childs play  meanwhile the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy state and mrs maylie and rose looked on with anxious faces  upon my word he said making a halt after a great number of very rapid turns i hardly know what to do  surely said rose the poor childs story faithfully repeated to these men will be sufficient to exonerate him  i doubt it my dear young lady said the doctor shaking his head i dont think it would exonerate him either with them or with legal functionaries of a higher grade  what is he after all they would say  a runaway  judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities his story is a very doubtful one  you believe it surely interrupted rose  i believe it strange as it is and perhaps i may be an old fool for doing so rejoined the doctor but i dont think it is exactly the tale for a practical policeofficer nevertheless  why not demanded rose  because my pretty crossexaminer replied the doctor because viewed with their eyes there are many ugly points about it he can only prove the parts that look ill and none of those that look well confound the fellows they will have the why and the wherefore and will take nothing for granted  on his own showing you see he has been the companion of thieves for some time past he has been carried to a policeofficer on a charge of picking a gentlemans pocket he has been taken away forcibly from that gentlemans house to a place which he cannot describe or point out and of the situation of which he has not the remotest idea  he is brought down to chertsey by men who seem to have taken a violent fancy to him whether he will or no and is put through a window to rob a house and then just at the very moment when he is going to alarm the inmates and so do the very thing that would set him all to rights there rushes into the way a blundering dog of a halfbred butler and shoots him as if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for himself dont you see all this  i see it of course replied rose smiling at the doctors impetuosity but still i do not see anything in it to criminate the poor child  no replied the doctor of course not  bless the bright eyes of your sex  they never see whether for good or bad more than one side of any question and that is always the one which first presents itself to them  having given vent to this result of experience the doctor put his hands into his pockets and walked up and down the room with even greater rapidity than before  the more i think of it said the doctor the more i see that it will occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession of the boys real story  i am certain it will not be believed and even if they can do nothing to him in the end still the dragging it forward and giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it must interfere materially with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from misery  oh what is to be done cried rose  dear dear why did they send for these people  why indeed exclaimed mrs maylie  i would not have had them here for the world  all i know is said mr losberne at last  sitting down with a kind of desperate calmness that we must try and carry it off with a bold face  the object is a good one and that must be our excuse  the boy has strong symptoms of fever upon him and is in no condition to be talked to any more thats one comfort  we must make the best of it and if bad be the best it is no fault of ours  come in  well master said blathers entering the room followed by his colleague and making the door fast before he said any more this warnt a putup thing  and what the devils a putup thing demanded the doctor impatiently  we call it a putup robbery ladies said blathers turning to them as if he pitied their ignorance but had a contempt for the doctors when the servants is in it  nobody suspected them in this case said mrs maylie  wery likely not maam replied blathers but they might have been in it for all that  more likely on that wery account said duff  we find it was a town hand said blathers continuing his report for the style of work is firstrate  wery pretty indeed it is remarked duff in an undertone  there was two of em in it continued blathers and they had a boy with em thats plain from the size of the window  thats all to be said at present  well see this lad that youve got upstairs at once if you please  perhaps they will take something to drink first mrs maylie said the doctor his face brightening as if some new thought had occurred to him  oh to be sure exclaimed rose eagerly  you shall have it immediately if you will  why thank you miss said blathers drawing his coatsleeve across his mouth its dry work this sort of duty  anythink thats handy miss dont put yourself out of the way on our accounts  what shall it be asked the doctor following the young lady to the sideboard  a little drop of spirits master if its all the same replied blathers  its a cold ride from london maam and i always find that spirits comes home warmer to the feelings  this interesting communication was addressed to mrs maylie who received it very graciously  while it was being conveyed to her the doctor slipped out of the room  ah said mr blathers  not holding his wineglass by the stem but grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand and placing it in front of his chest i have seen a good many pieces of business like this in my time ladies  that crack down in the back lane at edmonton blathers said mr duff assisting his colleagues memory  that was something in this way warnt it rejoined mr blathers that was done by conkey chickweed that was  you always gave that to him replied duff  it was the family pet i tell you  conkey hadnt any more to do with it than i had  get out retorted mr blathers i know better  do you mind that time when conkey was robbed of his money though  what a start that was  better than any novelbook i ever see  what was that inquired rose  anxious to encourage any symptoms of goodhumour in the unwelcome visitors  it was a robbery miss that hardly anybody would have been down upon said blathers  this here conkey chickweed  conkey means nosey maam interposed duff  of course the lady knows that dont she demanded mr blathers always interrupting you are partner  this here conkey chickweed miss kept a publichouse over battlebridge way and he had a cellar where a good many young lords went to see cockfighting and badgerdrawing and that and a wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in for ive seen em offen  he warnt one of the family at that time and one night he was robbed of three hundred and twentyseven guineas in a canvas bag that was stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night by a tall man with a black patch over his eye who had concealed himself under the bed and after committing the robbery jumped slap out of window  which was only a story high he was wery quick about it  but conkey was quick too for he fired a blunderbuss arter him and roused the neighbourhood they set up a hueandcry directly and when they came to look about em found that conkey had hit the robber for there was traces of blood all the way to some palings a good distance off and there they lost em  however he had made off with the blunt and consequently the name of mr chickweed licensed witler appeared in the gazette among the other bankrupts and all manner of benefits and subscriptions and i dont know what all was got up for the poor man who was in a wery low state of mind about his loss and went up and down the streets for three or four days a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself one day he came up to the office all in a hurry and had a private interview with the magistrate who after a deal of talk rings the bell and orders jem spyers in jem was a active officer and tells him to go and assist mr chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house i see him spyers said chickweed pass my house yesterday morning why didnt you up and collar him says spyers  i was so struck all of a heap that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick says the poor man but were sure to have him for between ten and eleven oclock at night he passed again  spyers no sooner heard this than he put some clean linen and a comb in his pocket in case he should have to stop a day or two and away he goes and sets himself down at one of the publichouse windows behind the little red curtain with his hat on all ready to bolt out at a moments notice he was smoking his pipe here late at night when all of a sudden chickweed roars out here he is stop thief  murder  jem spyers dashes out and there he sees chickweed atearing down the street full cry  away goes spyers on goes chickweed round turns the people everybody roars out thieves and chickweed himself keeps on shouting all the time like mad  spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner shoots round sees a little crowd dives in which is the man dme says chickweed ive lost him again  it was a remarkable occurrence but he warnt to be seen nowhere so they went back to the publichouse next morning spyers took his old place and looked out from behind the curtain for a tall man with a black patch over his eye till his own two eyes ached again  at last he couldnt help shutting em to ease em a minute and the very moment he did so he hears chickweed aroaring out here he is  off he starts once more with chickweed halfway down the street ahead of him and after twice as long a run as the yesterdays one the mans lost again  this was done once or twice more till onehalf the neighbours gave out that mr chickweed had been robbed by the devil who was playing tricks with him arterwards and the other half that poor mr chickweed had gone mad with grief  what did jem spyers say inquired the doctor who had returned to the room shortly after the commencement of the story  jem spyers resumed the officer for a long time said nothing at all and listened to everything without seeming to which showed he understood his business  but one morning he walked into the bar and taking out his snuffbox says chickweed ive found out who done this here robbery  have you said chickweed  oh my dear spyers only let me have wengeance and i shall die contented  oh my dear spyers where is the villain  come said spyers offering him a pinch of snuff none of that gammon  you did it yourself  so he had and a good bit of money he had made by it too and nobody would never have found it out if he hadnt been so precious anxious to keep up appearances said mr blathers putting down his wineglass and clinking the handcuffs together  very curious indeed observed the doctor  now if you please you can walk upstairs  if you please sir returned mr blathers  closely following mr losberne the two officers ascended to olivers bedroom mr giles preceding the party with a lighted candle  oliver had been dozing but looked worse and was more feverish than he had appeared yet  being assisted by the doctor he managed to sit up in bed for a minute or so and looked at the strangers without at all understanding what was going forwardin fact without seeming to recollect where he was or what had been passing  this said mr losberne speaking softly but with great vehemence notwithstanding this is the lad who being accidently wounded by a springgun in some boyish trespass on mr whatd yecallhims grounds at the back here comes to the house for assistance this morning and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated by that ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand  who has placed his life in considerable danger as i can professionally certify  messrs blathers and duff looked at mr giles as he was thus recommended to their notice  the bewildered butler gazed from them towards oliver and from oliver towards mr losberne with a most ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity  you dont mean to deny that i suppose said the doctor laying oliver gently down again  it was all done for thefor the best sir answered giles i am sure i thought it was the boy or i wouldnt have meddled with him  i am not of an inhuman disposition sir  thought it was what boy inquired the senior officer  the housebreakers boy sir replied giles  theythey certainly had a boy  well  do you think so now inquired blathers  think what now replied giles looking vacantly at his questioner  think its the same boy stupidhead rejoined blathers impatiently  i dont know i really dont know said giles with a rueful countenance  i couldnt swear to him  what do you think asked mr blathers  i dont know what to think replied poor giles  i dont think it is the boy indeed im almost certain that it isnt  you know it cant be  has this man been adrinking sir inquired blathers turning to the doctor  what a precious muddleheaded chap you are said duff addressing mr giles with supreme contempt  mr losberne had been feeling the patients pulse during this short dialogue but he now rose from the chair by the bedside and remarked that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject they would perhaps like to step into the next room and have brittles before them  acting upon this suggestion they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment where mr brittles being called in involved himself and his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and impossibilities as tended to throw no particular light on anything but the fact of his own strong mystification except indeed his declarations that he shouldnt know the real boy if he were put before him that instant that he had only taken oliver to be he because mr giles had said he was and that mr giles had five minutes previously admitted in the kitchen that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too hasty  among other ingenious surmises the question was then raised whether mr giles had really hit anybody and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired it turned out to have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before upon no one however did it make a greater impression than on mr giles himself who after labouring for some hours under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellowcreature eagerly caught at this new idea and favoured it to the utmost  finally the officers without troubling themselves very much about oliver left the chertsey constable in the house and took up their rest for that night in the town promising to return the next morning  with the next morning there came a rumour that two men and a boy were in the cage at kingston who had been apprehended over night under suspicious circumstances and to kingston messrs blathers and duff journeyed accordingly the suspicious circumstances however resolving themselves on investigation into the one fact that they had been discovered sleeping under a haystack which although a great crime is only punishable by imprisonment and is in the merciful eye of the english law and its comprehensive love of all the kings subjects held to be no satisfactory proof in the absence of all other evidence that the sleeper or sleepers have committed burglary accompanied with violence and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death messrs blathers and duff came back again as wise as they went  in short after some more examination and a great deal more conversation a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of mrs maylie and mr losberne for olivers appearance if he should ever be called upon and blathers and duff being rewarded with a couple of guineas returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their expedition the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the circumstances inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had originated with the family pet and the former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the great mr conkey chickweed  meanwhile oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of mrs maylie rose and the kindhearted mr losberne  if fervent prayers gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude be heard in heavenand if they be not what prayers arethe blessings which the orphan child called down upon them sunk into their souls diffusing peace and happiness
