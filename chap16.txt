chapter xv  showing how very fond of oliver twist the merry old jew and miss nancy were  in the obscure parlour of a low publichouse in the filthiest part of little saffron hill a dark and gloomy den where a flaring gaslight burnt all day in the wintertime and where no ray of sun ever shone in the summer  there sat brooding over a little pewter measure and a small glass strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor a man in a velveteen coat drab shorts halfboots and stockings whom even by that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as mr william sikes  at his feet sat a whitecoated redeyed dog who occupied himself alternately in winking at his master with both eyes at the same time and in licking a large fresh cut on one side of his mouth which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict  keep quiet you warmint  keep quiet said mr sikes suddenly breaking silence  whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the dogs winking or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them is matter for argument and consideration  whatever was the cause the effect was a kick and a curse bestowed upon the dog simultaneously  dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by their masters but mr sikess dog having faults of temper in common with his owner and labouring perhaps at this moment under a powerful sense of injury made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the halfboots  having given in a hearty shake he retired growling under a form just escaping the pewter measure which mr sikes levelled at his head  you would would you said sikes seizing the poker in one hand and deliberately opening with the other a large claspknife which he drew from his pocket  come here you born devil  come here  dye hear  the dog no doubt heard because mr sikes spoke in the very harshest key of a very harsh voice but appearing to entertain some unaccountable objection to having his throat cut he remained where he was and growled more fiercely than before  at the same time grasping the end of the poker between his teeth and biting at it like a wild beast  this resistance only infuriated mr sikes the more who dropping on his knees began to assail the animal most furiously  the dog jumped from right to left and from left to right snapping growling and barking the man thrust and swore and struck and blasphemed and the struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other when the door suddenly opening the dog darted out  leaving bill sikes with the poker and the claspknife in his hands  there must always be two parties to a quarrel says the old adage  mr sikes being disappointed of the dogs participation at once transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer  what the devil do you come in between me and my dog for said sikes with a fierce gesture  i didnt know my dear i didnt know replied fagin humbly for the jew was the new comer  didnt know you whitelivered thief growled sikes couldnt you hear the noise  not a sound of it as im a living man bill replied the jew  oh no  you hear nothing you dont retorted sikes with a fierce sneer  sneaking in and out so as nobody hears how you come or go  i wish you had been the dog fagin half a minute ago  why inquired the jew with a forced smile  cause the government as cares for the lives of such men as you as havent half the pluck of curs lets a man kill a dog how he likes replied sikes shutting up the knife with a very expressive look thats why  the jew rubbed his hands and sitting down at the table affected to laugh at the pleasantry of his friend  he was obviously very ill at ease however  grin away said sikes replacing the poker and surveying him with savage contempt grin away  youll never have the laugh at me though unless its behind a nightcap  ive got the upper hand over you fagin and dme ill keep it  there  if i go you go so take care of me  well well my dear said the jew i know all that wewehave a mutual interest billa mutual interest  humph said sikes as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the jews side than on his  well what have you got to say to me  its all passed safe through the meltingpot replied fagin and this is your share  its rather more than it ought to be my dear but as i know youll do me a good turn another time and  stow that gammon interposed the robber impatiently where is it hand over  yes yes bill give me time give me time replied the jew soothingly  here it is  all safe  as he spoke he drew forth an old cotton handkerchief from his breast and untying a large knot in one corner produced a small brownpaper packet  sikes snatching it from him hastily opened it and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained  this is all is it inquired sikes  all replied the jew  you havent opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along have you inquired sikes suspiciously dont put on an injured look at the question youve done it many a time jerk the tinkler  these words in plain english conveyed an injunction to ring the bell it was answered by another jew  younger than fagin but nearly as vile and repulsive in appearance  bill sikes merely pointed to the empty measure  the jew perfectly understanding the hint retired to fill it  previously exchanging a remarkable look with fagin who raised his eyes for an instant as if in expectation of it and shook his head in reply so slightly that the action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person  it was lost upon sikes who was stooping at the moment to tie the bootlace which the dog had torn  possibly if he had observed the brief interchange of signals he might have thought that it boded no good to him  is anybody here barney inquired fagin speaking now that that sikes was looking on without raising his eyes from the ground  dot a shoul replied barney whose words  whether they came from the heart or not  made their way through the nose  nobody inquired fagin in a tone of surprise  which perhaps might mean that barney was at liberty to tell the truth  dobody but biss dadsy replied barney  nancy exclaimed sikes  where  strike me blind if i dont honour that ere girl for her native talents  shes bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar replied barney  send her here said sikes pouring out a glass of liquor send her here  barney looked timidly at fagin as if for permission the jew remaining silent and not lifting his eyes from the ground he retired and presently returned ushering in nancy who was decorated with the bonnet apron basket and streetdoor key complete  you are on the scent are you nancy inquired sikes proffering the glass  yes i am bill replied the young lady disposing of its contents and tired enough of it i am too  the young brats been ill and confined to the crib and  ah nancy dear said fagin looking up  now whether a peculiar contraction of the jews red eyebrows and a half closing of his deeplyset eyes warned miss nancy that she was disposed to be too communicative is not a matter of much importance the fact is all we need care for here and the fact is that she suddenly checked herself and with several gracious smiles upon mr sikes turned the conversation to other matters in about ten minutes time mr fagin was seized with a fit of coughing upon which nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders and declared it was time to go mr sikes finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself expressed his intention of accompanying her they went away together followed at a little distant by the dog who slunk out of a backyard as soon as his master was out of sight  the jew thrust his head out of the room door when sikes had left it looked after him as we walked up the dark passage shook his clenched fist muttered a deep curse and then with a horrible grin reseated himself at the table where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting pages of the hueandcry  meanwhile oliver twist little dreaming that he was within so very short a distance of the merry old gentleman was on his way to the bookstall  when he got into clerkenwell he accidently turned down a bystreet which was not exactly in his way but not discovering his mistake until he had got halfway down it and knowing it must lead in the right direction he did not think it worth while to turn back and so marched on as quickly as he could with the books under his arm  he was walking along thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel and how much he would give for only one look at poor little dick who starved and beaten might be weeping bitterly at that very moment when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud  oh my dear brother  and he had hardly looked up to see what the matter was when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck  dont cried oliver struggling  let go of me  who is it what are you stopping me for  the only reply to this was a great number of loud lamentations from the young woman who had embraced him and who had a little basket and a streetdoor key in her hand  oh my gracious said the young woman i have found him  oh oliver oliver  oh you naughty boy to make me suffer such distress on your account  come home dear come  oh ive found him  thank gracious goodness heavins ive found him  with these incoherent exclamations the young woman burst into another fit of crying and got so dreadfully hysterical that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a butchers boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet who was also looking on whether he didnt think he had better run for the doctor  to which the butchers boy  who appeared of a lounging not to say indolent disposition  replied that he thought not  oh no no never mind said the young woman grasping olivers hand im better now  come home directly you cruel boy come  oh maam replied the young woman he ran away near a month ago from his parents who are hardworking and respectable people and went and joined a set of thieves and bad characters and almost broke his mothers heart  young wretch said one woman  go home do you little brute said the other  i am not replied oliver greatly alarmed  i dont know her i havent any sister or father and mother either  im an orphan i live at pentonville  only hear him how he braves it out cried the young woman  why its nancy exclaimed oliver who now saw her face for the first time and started back in irrepressible astonishment  you see he knows me cried nancy appealing to the bystanders he cant help himself  make him come home theres good people or hell kill his dear mother and father and break my heart  what the devils this said a man bursting out of a beershop with a white dog at his heels young oliver come home to your poor mother you young dog  come home directly  i dont belong to them  i dont know them  help help cried oliver struggling in the mans powerful grasp  help repeated the man  yes ill help you you young rascal  what books are these  youve been a stealing em have you give em here  with these words the man tore the volumes from his grasp and struck him on the head  thats right cried a lookeron from a garretwindow thats the only way of bringing him to his senses  to be sure cried a sleepyfaced carpenter casting an approving look at the garretwindow  itll do him good said the two women  and he shall have it too rejoined the man administering another blow and seizing oliver by the collar  come on you young villain here bullseye mind him boy  mind him  weak with recent illness stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the attack terrified by the fierce growling of the dog and the brutality of the man overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be what could one poor child do  darkness had set in it was a low neighborhood no help was near resistance was useless  in another moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts and was forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to unintelligible  it was of little moment indeed whether they were intelligible or no for there was nobody to care for them had they been ever so plain                                   the gaslamps were lighted mrs bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open door the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were any traces of oliver and still the two old gentlemen sat perseveringly in the dark parlour with the watch between them
