chapter v  oliver mingles with new associates  going to a funeral for the first time he forms an unfavourable notion of his masters business  oliver being left to himself in the undertakers shop set the lamp down on a workmans bench and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe and dread which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss to understand  an unfinished coffin on black tressels which stood in the middle of the shop looked so gloomy and deathlike that a cold tremble came over him every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal object from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly rear its head to drive him mad with terror against the wall were ranged in regular array a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape looking in the dim light like highshouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets coffinplates elmchips brightheaded nails and shreds of black cloth lay scattered on the floor and the wall behind the counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff neckcloths on duty at a large private door with a hearse drawn by four black steeds approaching in the distance the shop was close and hot  the atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins  the recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust looked like a grave  nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed oliver he was alone in a strange place and we all know how chilled and desolate the best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation the boy had no friends to care for or to care for him  the regret of no recent separation was fresh in his mind the absence of no loved and wellremembered face sank heavily into his heart  but his heart was heavy notwithstanding and he wished as he crept into his narrow bed that that were his coffin and that he could be lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground with the tall grass waving gently above his head and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe him in his sleep  oliver was awakened in the morning by a loud kicking at the outside of the shopdoor which before he could huddle on his clothes was repeated in an angry and impetuous manner about twentyfive times when he began to undo the chain the legs desisted and a voice began  open the door will yer cried the voice which belonged to the legs which had kicked at the door  i will directly sir replied oliver undoing the chain and turning the key  i suppose yer the new boy aint yer said the voice through the keyhole  yes sir replied oliver  how old are yer inquired the voice  ten sir replied oliver  then ill whop yer when i get in said the voice you just see if i dont thats all my workus brat and having made this obliging promise the voice began to whistle  oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference to entertain the smallest doubt that the owner of the voice whoever he might be would redeem his pledge most honourably he drew back the bolts with a trembling hand and opened the door  for a second or two oliver glanced up the street and down the street and over the way impressed with the belief that the unknown who had addressed him through the keyhole had walked a few paces off to warm himself for nobody did he see but a big charityboy sitting on a post in front of the house eating a slice of bread and butter which he cut into wedges the size of his mouth with a claspknife and then consumed with great dexterity  i beg your pardon sir said oliver at length seeing that no other visitor made his appearance did you knock  i kicked replied the charityboy  did you want a coffin sir inquired oliver innocently  at this the charityboy looked monstrous fierce and said that oliver would want one before long if he cut jokes with his superiors in that way  yer dont know who i am i suppose workus said the charityboy in continuation descending from the top of the post meanwhile with edifying gravity  no sir rejoined oliver  im mister noah claypole said the charityboy and youre under me take down the shutters yer idle young ruffian with this mr claypole administered a kick to oliver and entered the shop with a dignified air which did him great credit  it is difficult for a largeheaded smalleyed youth of lumbering make and heavy countenance to look dignified under any circumstances but it is more especially so when superadded to these personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls  oliver having taken down the shutters and broken a pane of glass in his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day was graciously assisted by noah who having consoled him with the assurance that hed catch it condescended to help him  mr sowerberry came down soon after shortly afterwards mrs sowerberry appeared  oliver having caught it in fulfilment of noahs prediction followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast  come near the fire noah said charlotte  i saved a nice little bit of bacon for you from masters breakfast  oliver shut that door at mister noahs back and take them bits that ive put out on the cover of the breadpan  theres your tea take it away to that box and drink it there and make haste for theyll want you to mind the shop dye hear  dye hear workus said noah claypole  lor noah said charlotte what a rum creature you are  why dont you let the boy alone  let him alone said noah  why everybody lets him alone enough for the matter of that  neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with him  all his relations let him have his own way pretty well  eh charlotte  he he he  oh you queer soul said charlotte bursting into a hearty laugh in which she was joined by noah after which they both looked scornfully at poor oliver twist as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of the room and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for him  noah was a charityboy but not a workhouse orphan  no chancechild was he for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents who lived hard by his mother being a washerwoman and his father a drunken soldier discharged with a wooden leg and a diurnal pension of twopencehalfpenny and an unstateable fraction  the shopboys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding noah in the public streets with the ignominious epithets of leathers charity and the like and noah had bourne them without reply  but now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan at whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn he retorted on him with interest  this affords charming food for contemplation  it shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be and how impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charityboy  oliver had been sojourning at the undertakers some three weeks or a month  mr and mrs sowerberrythe shop being shut upwere taking their supper in the little backparlour when mr sowerberry after several deferential glances at his wife said  my dear  he was going to say more but mrs sowerberry looking up with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect he stopped short  well said mrs sowerberry sharply  nothing my dear nothing said mr sowerberry  ugh you brute said mrs sowerberry  not at all my dear said mr sowerberry humbly  i thought you didnt want to hear my dear  i was only going to say  oh dont tell me what you were going to say interposed mrs sowerberry  i am nobody dont consult me pray  i dont want to intrude upon your secrets  as mrs sowerberry said this she gave an hysterical laugh which threatened violent consequences  but my dear said sowerberry i want to ask your advice  no no dont ask mine replied mrs sowerberry in an affecting manner ask somebody elses  here there was another hysterical laugh which frightened mr sowerberry very much  this is a very common and muchapproved matrimonial course of treatment which is often very effective it at once reduced mr sowerberry to begging as a special favour to be allowed to say what mrs sowerberry was most curious to hear  after a short duration the permission was most graciously conceded  its only about young twist my dear said mr sowerberry a very goodlooking boy that my dear  he need be for he eats enough observed the lady  theres an expression of melancholy in his face my dear resumed mr sowerberry which is very interesting  he would make a delightful mute my love  mrs sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment  mr sowerberry remarked it and without allowing time for any observation on the good ladys part proceeded  i dont mean a regular mute to attend grownup people my dear but only for childrens practice  it would be very new to have a mute in proportion my dear  you may depend upon it it would have a superb effect  mrs sowerberry who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way was much struck by the novelty of this idea but as it would have been compromising her dignity to have said so under existing circumstances she merely inquired with much sharpness why such an obvious suggestion had not presented itself to her husbands mind before  mr sowerberry rightly construed this as an acquiescence in his proposition it was speedily determined therefore that oliver should be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade and with this view that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being required  the occasion was not long in coming  half an hour after breakfast next morning mr bumble entered the shop and supporting his cane against the counter drew forth his large leathern pocketbook from which he selected a small scrap of paper which he handed over to sowerberry  aha said the undertaker glancing over it with a lively countenance an order for a coffin eh  for a coffin first and a porochial funeral afterwards replied mr bumble fastening the strap of the leathern pocketbook which like himself was very corpulent  bayton said the undertaker looking from the scrap of paper to mr bumble  i never heard the name before  bumble shook his head as he replied obstinate people mr sowerberry very obstinate  proud too im afraid sir  proud eh exclaimed mr sowerberry with a sneer  come thats too much  oh its sickening replied the beadle  antimonial mr sowerberry  so it is acquiesced the undertaker  we only heard of the family the night before last said the beadle and we shouldnt have known anything about them then only a woman who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad  he had gone out to dinner but his prentice which is a very clever lad sent em some medicine in a blackingbottle offhand  ah theres promptness said the undertaker  promptness indeed replied the beadle  but whats the consequence whats the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels sir  why the husband sends back word that the medicine wont suit his wifes complaint and so she shant take itsays she shant take it sir  good strong wholesome medicine as was given with great success to two irish labourers and a coalheaver only a week beforesent em for nothing with a blackinbottle inand he sends back word that she shant take it sir  as the atrocity presented itself to mr bumbles mind in full force he struck the counter sharply with his cane and became flushed with indignation  well said the undertaker i neverdid  never did sir ejaculated the beadle  no nor nobody never did but now shes dead weve got to bury her and thats the direction and the sooner its done the better  thus saying mr bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first in a fever of parochial excitement and flounced out of the shop  why he was so angry oliver that he forgot even to ask after you said mr sowerberry looking after the beadle as he strode down the street  yes sir replied oliver who had carefully kept himself out of sight during the interview and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere recollection of the sound of mr bumbles voice  he neednt haven taken the trouble to shrink from mr bumbles glance however for that functionary on whom the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression thought that now the undertaker had got oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus effectually and legally overcome  well said mr sowerberry taking up his hat the sooner this job is done the better  noah look after the shop oliver put on your cap and come with me  oliver obeyed and followed his master on his professional mission  they walked on for some time through the most crowded and densely inhabited part of the town and then striking down a narrow street more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through paused to look for the house which was the object of their search  the houses on either side were high and large but very old and tenanted by people of the poorest class as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently denoted without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of the few men and women who with folded arms and bodies half doubled occasionally skulked along  a great many of the tenements had shopfronts but these were fast closed and mouldering away only the upper rooms being inhabited  some houses which had become insecure from age and decay were prevented from falling into the street by huge beams of wood reared against the walls and firmly planted in the road but even these crazy dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window were wrenched from their positions to afford an aperture wide enough for the passage of a human body  the kennel was stagnant and filthy the very rats which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness were hideous with famine  there was neither knocker nor bellhandle at the open door where oliver and his master stopped so groping his way cautiously through the dark passage and bidding oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs  stumbling against a door on the landing he rapped at it with his knuckles  it was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen  the undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained to know it was the apartment to which he had been directed  he stepped in oliver followed him  there was no fire in the room but a man was crouching mechanically over the empty stove  an old woman too had drawn a low stool to the cold hearth and was sitting beside him there were some ragged children in another corner and in a small recess opposite the door there lay upon the ground something covered with an old blanket oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place and crept involuntarily closer to his master for though it was covered up the boy felt that it was a corpse  the mans face was thin and very pale his hair and beard were grizzly his eyes were bloodshot  the old womans face was wrinkled her two remaining teeth protruded over her under lip and her eyes were bright and piercing  oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man they seemed so like the rats he had seen outside  nobody shall go near her said the man starting fiercely up as the undertaker approached the recess keep back damn you keep back if youve a life to lose  nonsense my good man said the undertaker who was pretty well used to misery in all its shapes  nonsense  i tell you said the man  clenching his hands and stamping furiously on the floori tell you i wont have her put into the ground  she couldnt rest there  the worms would worry hernot eat hershe is so worn away  the undertaker offered no reply to this raving but producing a tape from his pocket knelt down for a moment by the side of the body  ah said the man bursting into tears and sinking on his knees at the feet of the dead woman kneel down kneel downkneel round her every one of you and mark my words  i say she was starved to death i never knew how bad she was till the fever came upon her and then her bones were starting through the skin  there was neither fire nor candle she died in the darkin the dark  she couldnt even see her childrens faces though we heard her gasping out their names i begged for her in the streets and they sent me to prison when i came back she was dying and all the blood in my heart has dried up for they starved her to death  i swear it before the god that saw it they starved her  he twined his hands in his hair and with a loud scream rolled grovelling upon the floor his eyes fixed and the foam covering his lips  the terrified children cried bitterly but the old woman who had hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed menaced them into silence  having unloosened the cravat of the man who still remained extended on the ground she tottered towards the undertaker  she was my daughter said the old woman nodding her head in the direction of the corpse and speaking with an idiotic leer more ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place lord lord well it is strange that i who gave birth to her and was a woman then should be alive and merry now and she lying there so cold and stiff  lord lordto think of it its as good as a playas good as a play  as the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment the undertaker turned to go away  stop stop said the old woman in a loud whisper  will she be buried tomorrow or next day or tonight  i laid her out and i must walk you know  send me a large cloak a good warm one for it is bitter cold  we should have cake and wine too before we go  never mind send some breadonly a loaf of bread and a cup of water  shall we have some bread dear she said eagerly catching at the undertakers coat as he once more moved towards the door  yes yes said the undertakerof course  anything you like he disengaged himself from the old womans grasp and drawing oliver after him hurried away  the next day the family having been meanwhile relieved with a halfquartern loaf and a piece of cheese left with them by mr bumble himself oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode where mr bumble had already arrived accompanied by four men from the workhouse who were to act as bearers  an old black cloak had been thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man and the bare coffin having been screwed down was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers and carried into the street  now you must put your best leg foremost old lady whispered sowerberry in the old womans ear we are rather late and it wont do to keep the clergyman waiting  move on my menas quick as you like  thus directed the bearers trotted on under their light burden and the two mourners kept as near them as they could  mr bumble and sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front and oliver whose legs were not so long as his masters ran by the side  there was not so great a necessity for hurrying as mr sowerberry had anticipated however for when they reached the obscure corner of the churchyard in which the nettles grew and where the parish graves were made the clergyman had not arrived and the clerk who was sitting by the vestryroom fire seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might be an hour or so before he came  so they put the bier on the brink of the grave and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay with a cold rain drizzling down while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hideandseek among the tombstones or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin  mr sowerberry and bumble being personal friends of the clerk sat by the fire with him and read the paper  at length after a lapse of something more than an hour mr bumble and sowerberry and the clerk were seen running towards the grave immediately afterwards the clergyman appeared putting on his surplice as he came along  mr bumble then thrashed a boy or two to keep up appearances and the reverend gentleman having read as much of the burial service as could be compressed into four minutes gave his surplice to the clerk and walked away again  now bill said sowerberry to the gravedigger fill up  it was no very difficult task for the grave was so full that the uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface  the gravedigger shovelled in the earth stamped it loosely down with his feet shouldered his spade and walked off followed by the boys who murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon  come my good fellow said bumble tapping the man on the back they want to shut up the yard  the man who had never once moved since he had taken his station by the grave side started raised his head stared at the person who had addressed him walked forward for a few paces and fell down in a swoon  the crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her cloak which the undertaker had taken off to pay him any attention so they threw a can of cold water over him and when he came to saw him safely out of the churchyard locked the gate and departed on their different ways  well oliver said sowerberry as they walked home how do you like it  pretty well thank you sir replied oliver with considerable hesitation  not very much sir  ah youll get used to it in time oliver said sowerberry nothing when you are used to it my boy  oliver wondered in his own mind whether it had taken a very long time to get mr sowerberry used to it  but he thought it better not to ask the question and walked back to the shop thinking over all he had seen and heard
