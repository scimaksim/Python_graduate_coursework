chapter ii  treats of oliver twists growth education and board  for the next eight or ten months oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception  he was brought up by hand  the hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities  the parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities whether there was no female then domiciled in the house who was in a situation to impart to oliver twist the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need  the workhouse authorities replied with humility that there was not upon this the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved that oliver should be farmed or in other words that he should be dispatched to a branchworkhouse some three miles off where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poorlaws rolled about the floor all day without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing under the parental superintendence of an elderly female who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpencehalfpenny per small head per week sevenpencehalfpennys worth per week is a good round diet for a child a great deal may be got for sevenpencehalfpenny quite enough to overload its stomach and make it uncomfortable the elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience she knew what was good for children and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself so she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them  thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher  everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating and who demonstrated it so well that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all if he had not died fourandtwenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air  unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care oliver twist was delivered over a similar result usually attended the operation of her system for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten either that it sickened from want and cold or fell into the fire from neglect or got halfsmothered by accident in any one of which cases the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this  occasionally when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washingthough the latter accident was very scarce anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farmthe jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance  but these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon and the testimony of the beadle the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside which was very probable indeed and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted which was very selfdevotional  besides the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm and always sent the beadle the day before to say they were going  the children were neat and clean to behold when they went and what more would the people have  it cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop  oliver twists ninth birthday found him a pale thin child somewhat diminutive in stature and decidedly small in circumference  but nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in olivers breast  it had had plenty of room to expand thanks to the spare diet of the establishment and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birthday at all  be this as it may however it was his ninth birthday and he was keeping it in the coalcellar with a select party of two other young gentleman who after participating with him in a sound thrashing had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry when mrs mann the good lady of the house was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of mr bumble the beadle striving to undo the wicket of the gardengate  goodness gracious  is that you mr bumble sir said mrs mann thrusting her head out of the window in wellaffected ecstasies of joy susan take oliver and them two brats upstairs and wash em directlymy heart alive  mr bumble how glad i am to see you surely  now mr bumble was a fat man and a choleric so instead of responding to this openhearted salutation in a kindred spirit he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadles  lor only think said mrs mann running outfor the three boys had been removed by this timeonly think of that  that i should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside on account of them dear children  walk in sir walk in pray mr bumble do sir  although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a churchwarden it by no means mollified the beadle  do you think this respectful or proper conduct mrs mann inquired mr bumble grasping his cane to keep the parish officers a waiting at your gardengate when they come here upon porochial business with the porochial orphans  are you aweer mrs mann that you are as i may say a porochial delegate and a stipendiary  im sure mr bumble that i was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you that it was you a coming replied mrs mann with great humility  mr bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance  he had displayed the one and vindicated the other he relaxed  well well mrs mann he replied in a calmer tone it may be as you say it may be  lead the way in mrs mann for i come on business and have something to say  mrs mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor placed a seat for him and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane on the table before him  mr bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered glanced complacently at the cocked hat and smiled  yes he smiled  beadles are but men and mr bumble smiled  now dont you be offended at what im a going to say observed mrs mann with captivating sweetness  youve had a long walk you know or i wouldnt mention it  now will you take a little drop of somethink mr bumble  not a drop  nor a drop said mr bumble waving his right hand in a dignified but placid manner  i think you will said mrs mann who had noticed the tone of the refusal and the gesture that had accompanied it  just a leetle drop with a little cold water and a lump of sugar  mr bumble coughed  now just a leetle drop said mrs mann persuasively  what is it inquired the beadle  why its what im obliged to keep a little of in the house to put into the blessed infants daffy when they aint well mr bumble replied mrs mann as she opened a corner cupboard and took down a bottle and glass  its gin  ill not deceive you mr b  its gin  do you give the children daffy mrs mann inquired bumble following with his eyes the interesting process of mixing  ah bless em that i do dear as it is replied the nurse i couldnt see em suffer before my very eyes you know sir  no said mr bumble approvingly no you could not  you are a humane woman mrs mann  here she set down the glass  i shall take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board mrs mann he drew it towards him  you feel as a mother mrs mann  he stirred the ginandwater ii drink your health with cheerfulness mrs mann and he swallowed half of it  and now about business said the beadle taking out a leathern pocketbook  the child that was halfbaptized oliver twist is nine year old today  bless him interposed mrs mann inflaming her left eye with the corner of her apron  and notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound which was afterwards increased to twenty pound  notwithstanding the most superlative and i may say supernatral exertions on the part of this parish said bumble we have never been able to discover who is his father or what was his mothers settlement name or condition  mrs mann raised her hands in astonishment but added after a moments reflection how comes he to have any name at all then  the beadle drew himself up with great pride and said i inwented it  you mr bumble  i mrs mann  we name our fondlings in alphabetical order the last was a sswubble i named him this was a ttwist i named him the next one comes will be unwin and the next vilkins  i have got names ready made to the end of the alphabet and all the way through it again when we come to z  why youre quite a literary character sir said mrs mann  well well said the beadle evidently gratified with the compliment perhaps i may be  perhaps i may be mrs mann he finished the ginandwater and added oliver being now too old to remain here the board have determined to have him back into the house  i have come out myself to take him there  so let me see him at once  ill fetch him directly said mrs mann leaving the room for that purpose  oliver having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt which encrusted his face and hands removed as could be scrubbed off in one washing was led into the room by his benevolent protectress  make a bow to the gentleman oliver said mrs mann  oliver made a bow which was divided between the beadle on the chair and the cocked hat on the table  will you go along with me oliver said mr bumble in a majestic voice  oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great readiness when glancing upward he caught sight of mrs mann who had got behind the beadles chair and was shaking her fist at him with a furious countenance  he took the hint at once for the fist had been too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his recollection  will she go with me inquired poor oliver  no she cant replied mr bumble  but shell come and see you sometimes  this was no very great consolation to the child  young as he was however he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away  it was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes  hunger and recent illusage are great assistants if you want to cry and oliver cried very naturally indeed  mrs mann gave him a thousand embraces and what oliver wanted a great deal more a piece of bread and butter less he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse with the slice of bread in his hand and the little browncloth parish cap on his head oliver was then led away by mr bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant years  and yet he burst into an agony of childish grief as the cottagegate closed after him  wretched as were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind they were the only friends he had ever known and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world sank into the childs heart for the first time  mr bumble walked on with long strides little oliver firmly grasping his goldlaced cuff trotted beside him inquiring at the end of every quarter of a mile whether they were nearly there to these interrogations mr bumble returned very brief and snappish replies for the temporary blandness which ginandwater awakens in some bosoms had by this time evaporated and he was once again a beadle  oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an hour and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of bread when mr bumble who had handed him over to the care of an old woman returned and telling him it was a board night informed him that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith  not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence and was not quite certain whether he ought to laugh or cry  he had no time to think about the matter however for mr bumble gave him a tap on the head with his cane to wake him up and another on the back to make him lively and bidding him to follow conducted him into a large whitewashed room where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table  at the top of the table seated in an armchair rather higher than the rest was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round red face  bow to the board said bumble  oliver brushed away two or three tears that were lingering in his eyes and seeing no board but the table fortunately bowed to that  whats your name boy said the gentleman in the high chair  oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen which made him tremble and the beadle gave him another tap behind which made him cry  these two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool which was a capital way of raising his spirits and putting him quite at his ease  boy said the gentleman in the high chair listen to me you know youre an orphan i suppose  whats that sir inquired poor oliver  the boy is a fooli thought he was said the gentleman in the white waistcoat  hush said the gentleman who had spoken first  you know youve got no father or mother and that you were brought up by the parish dont you  yes sir replied oliver weeping bitterly  what are you crying for inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat  and to be sure it was very extraordinary  what could the boy be crying for  i hope you say your prayers every night said another gentleman in a gruff voice and pray for the people who feed you and take care of youlike a christian  yes sir stammered the boy  the gentleman who spoke last was unconsciously right  it would have been very like a christian and a marvellously good christian too if oliver had prayed for the people who fed and took care of him but he hadnt because nobody had taught him  well  you have come here to be educated and taught a useful trade said the redfaced gentleman in the high chair  so youll begin to pick oakum tomorrow morning at six oclock added the surly one in the white waistcoat  for the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of picking oakum oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle and was then hurried away to a large ward where on a rough hard bed he sobbed himself to sleep  what a novel illustration of the tender laws of england  they let the paupers go to sleep  poor oliver  he little thought as he lay sleeping in happy unconsciousness of all around him that the board had that very day arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence over all his future fortunes  but they had  and this was it  the members of this board were very sage deep philosophical men and when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse they found out at once what ordinary folks would never have discoveredthe poor people liked it  it was a regular place of public entertainment for the poorer classes a tavern where there was nothing to pay a public breakfast dinner tea and supper all the year round a brick and mortar elysium where it was all play and no work  oho said the board looking very knowing we are the fellows to set this to rights well stop it all in no time  so they established the rule that all poor people should have the alternative for they would compel nobody not they of being starved by a gradual process in the house or by a quick one out of it  with this view they contracted with the waterworks to lay on an unlimited supply of water and with a cornfactor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal and issued three meals of thin gruel a day with an onion twice a week and half a roll of sundays  they made a great many other wise and humane regulations having reference to the ladies which it is not necessary to repeat kindly undertook to divorce poor married people in consequence of the great expense of a suit in doctors commons and instead of compelling a man to support his family as they had theretofore done took his family away from him and made him a bachelor  there is no saying how many applicants for relief under these last two heads might have started up in all classes of society if it had not been coupled with the workhouse but the board were longheaded men and had provided for this difficulty  the relief was inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel and that frightened people  for the first six months after oliver twist was removed the system was in full operation  it was rather expensive at first in consequence of the increase in the undertakers bill and the necessity of taking in the clothes of all the paupers which fluttered loosely on their wasted shrunken forms after a week or twos gruel  but the number of workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers and the board were in ecstasies  the room in which the boys were fed was a large stone hall with a copper at one end out of which the master dressed in an apron for the purpose and assisted by one or two women ladled the gruel at mealtimes  of this festive composition each boy had one porringer and no moreexcept on occasions of great public rejoicing when he had two ounces and a quarter of bread besides  the bowls never wanted washing  the boys polished them with their spoons till they shone again and when they had performed this operation which never took very long the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls they would sit staring at the copper with such eager eyes as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed employing themselves meanwhile in sucking their fingers most assiduously with the view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast thereon  boys have generally excellent appetites oliver twist and his companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months at last they got so voracious and wild with hunger that one boy who was tall for his age and hadnt been used to that sort of thing for his father had kept a small cookshop hinted darkly to his companions that unless he had another basin of gruel per diem he was afraid he might some night happen to eat the boy who slept next him who happened to be a weakly youth of tender age  he had a wild hungry eye and they implicitly believed him a council was held lots were cast who should walk up to the master after supper that evening and ask for more and it fell to oliver twist  the evening arrived the boys took their places  the master in his cooks uniform stationed himself at the copper his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him the gruel was served out and a long grace was said over the short commons  the gruel disappeared the boys whispered each other and winked at oliver while his next neighbors nudged him  child as he was he was desperate with hunger and reckless with misery  he rose from the table and advancing to the master basin and spoon in hand said somewhat alarmed at his own temerity  please sir i want some more  the master was a fat healthy man but he turned very pale he gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds and then clung for support to the copper  the assistants were paralysed with wonder the boys with fear  what said the master at length in a faint voice  please sir replied oliver i want some more  the master aimed a blow at olivers head with the ladle pinioned him in his arm and shrieked aloud for the beadle  the board were sitting in solemn conclave when mr bumble rushed into the room in great excitement and addressing the gentleman in the high chair said  mr limbkins i beg your pardon sir  oliver twist has asked for more  there was a general start  horror was depicted on every countenance  for more said mr limbkins  compose yourself bumble and answer me distinctly  do i understand that he asked for more after he had eaten the supper allotted by the dietary  he did sir replied bumble  that boy will be hung said the gentleman in the white waistcoat  i know that boy will be hung  nobody controverted the prophetic gentlemans opinion  an animated discussion took place  oliver was ordered into instant confinement and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate offering a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take oliver twist off the hands of the parish  in other words five pounds and oliver twist were offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade business or calling  i never was more convinced of anything in my life said the gentleman in the white waistcoat as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next morning i never was more convinced of anything in my life than i am that that boy will come to be hung  as i purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman was right or not i should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative supposing it to possess any at all if i ventured to hint just yet whether the life of oliver twist had this violent termination or no
