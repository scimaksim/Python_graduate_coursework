chapter xlviii  the flight of sikes  of all bad deeds that under cover of the darkness had been committed within wide londons bounds since night hung over it that was the worst  of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air that was the foulest and most cruel  the sunthe bright sun that brings back not light alone but new life and hope and freshness to manburst upon the crowded city in clear and radiant glory  through costlycoloured glass and papermended window through cathedral dome and rotten crevice it shed its equal ray  it lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay it did  he tried to shut it out but it would stream in  if the sight had been a ghastly one in the dull morning what was it now in all that brilliant light  he had not moved he had been afraid to stir  there had been a moan and motion of the hand and with terror added to rage he had struck and struck again  once he threw a rug over it but it was worse to fancy the eyes and imagine them moving towards him than to see them glaring upward as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling  he had plucked it off again  and there was the bodymere flesh and blood no morebut such flesh and so much blood  he struck a light kindled a fire and thrust the club into it there was hair upon the end which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder and caught by the air whirled up the chimney  even that frightened him sturdy as he was but he held the weapon till it broke and then piled it on the coals to burn away and smoulder into ashes  he washed himself and rubbed his clothes there were spots that would not be removed but he cut the pieces out and burnt them  how those stains were dispersed about the room  the very feet of the dog were bloody  all this time he had never once turned his back upon the corpse no not for a moment  such preparations completed he moved backward towards the door  dragging the dog with him lest he should soil his feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets he shut the door softly locked it took the key and left the house  he crossed over and glanced up at the window to be sure that nothing was visible from the outside  there was the curtain still drawn which she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again  it lay nearly under there  he knew that  god how the sun poured down upon the very spot  the glance was instantaneous  it was a relief to have got free of the room  he whistled on the dog and walked rapidly away  he went through islington strode up the hill at highgate on which stands the stone in honour of whittington turned down to highgate hill unsteady of purpose and uncertain where to go struck off to the right again almost as soon as he began to descend it and taking the footpath across the fields skirted caen wood and so came on hampstead heath  traversing the hollow by the vale of heath he mounted the opposite bank and crossing the road which joins the villages of hampstead and highgate made along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at north end in one of which he laid himself down under a hedge and slept  soon he was up again and awaynot far into the country but back towards london by the highroadthen back againthen over another part of the same ground as he already traversedthen wandering up and down in fields and lying on ditches brinks to rest and starting up to make for some other spot and do the same and ramble on again  where could he go that was near and not too public to get some meat and drink  hendon  that was a good place not far off and out of most peoples way  thither he directed his stepsrunning sometimes and sometimes with a strange perversity loitering at a snails pace or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick  but when he got there all the people he metthe very children at the doorsseemed to view him with suspicion  back he turned again without the courage to purchase bit or drop though he had tasted no food for many hours and once more he lingered on the heath uncertain where to go  he wandered over miles and miles of ground and still came back to the old place  morning and noon had passed and the day was on the wane and still he rambled to and fro and up and down and round and round and still lingered about the same spot  at last he got away and shaped his course for hatfield  it was nine oclock at night when the man quite tired out and the dog limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise turned down the hill by the church of the quiet village and plodding along the little street crept into a small publichouse whose scanty light had guided them to the spot  there was a fire in the taproom and some countrylabourers were drinking before it  they made room for the stranger but he sat down in the furthest corner and ate and drank alone or rather with his dog  to whom he cast a morsel of food from time to time  the conversation of the men assembled here turned upon the neighbouring land and farmers and when those topics were exhausted upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous sunday the young men present considering him very old and the old men present declaring him to have been quite youngnot older one whitehaired grandfather said than he waswith ten or fifteen year of life in him at leastif he had taken care if he had taken care  there was nothing to attract attention or excite alarm in this the robber after paying his reckoning sat silent and unnoticed in his corner and had almost dropped asleep when he was half wakened by the noisy entrance of a new comer  this was an antic fellow half pedlar and half mountebank who travelled about the country on foot to vend hones strops razors washballs harnesspaste medicine for dogs and horses cheap perfumery cosmetics and suchlike wares which he carried in a case slung to his back  his entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen which slackened not until he had made his supper and opened his box of treasures when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement  and what be that stoof  good to eat harry asked a grinning countryman pointing to some compositioncakes in one corner  this said the fellow producing one this is the infallible and invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain rust dirt mildew spick speck spot or spatter from silk satin linen cambric cloth crape stuff carpet merino muslin bombazeen or woollen stuff  winestains fruitstains beerstains

nastier in the flavour consequently the more credit in taking it  one penny a square  with all these virtues one penny a square  there were two buyers directly and more of the listeners plainly hesitated  the vendor observing this increased in loquacity  its all bought up as fast as it can be made said the fellow there are fourteen watermills six steamengines and a galvanic battery always aworking upon it and they cant make it fast enough though the men work so hard that they die off and the widows is pensioned directly with twenty pound ayear for each of the children and a premium of fifty for twins  one penny a square  two halfpence is all the same and four farthings is received with joy  one penny a square winestains fruitstains beerstains waterstains paintstains pitchstains

than a halfcrown  whether it is a winestain fruitstain beerstain waterstain paintstain pitchstain mudstain or bloodstain  the man got no further for sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the table and tearing the hat from him burst out of the house  with the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened upon him despite himself all day the murderer finding that he was not followed and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen fellow turned back up the town and getting out of the glare of the lamps of a stagecoach that was standing in the street was walking past when he recognised the mail from london and saw that it was standing at the little postoffice  he almost knew what was to come but he crossed over and listened  the guard was standing at the door waiting for the letterbag a man dressed like a gamekeeper came up at the moment and he handed him a basket which lay ready on the pavement  thats for your people said the guard  now look alive in there will you  damn that ere bag it warnt ready night afore last this wont do you know  anything new up in town ben asked the gamekeeper drawing back to the windowshutters the better to admire the horses  no nothing that i knows on replied the man pulling on his gloves corns up a little  i heerd talk of a murder too down spitalfields way but i dont reckon much upon it  oh thats quite true said a gentleman inside who was looking out of the window  and a dreadful murder it was  was it sir rejoined the guard touching his hat  man or woman pray sir  a woman replied the gentleman  it is supposed  now ben replied the coachman impatiently  damn that ere bag said the guard are you gone to sleep in there  coming cried the office keeper running out  coming growled the guard  ah and sos the young ooman of property thats going to take a fancy to me but i dont know when here give hold  all riight  the horn sounded a few cheerful notes and the coach was gone  sikes remained standing in the street apparently unmoved by what he had just heard and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go  at length he went back again and took the road which leads from hatfield to st albans  he went on doggedly but as he left the town behind him and plunged into the solitude and darkness of the road he felt a dread and awe creeping upon him which shook him to the core every object before him substance or shadow still or moving took the semblance of some fearful thing but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that mornings ghastly figure following at his heels he could trace its shadow in the gloom supply the smallest item of the outline and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along  he could hear its garments rustling in the leaves and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry  if he stopped it did the same if he ran it followednot running too  that would have been a relief  but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell  at times he turned with desperate determination resolved to beat this phantom off though it should look him dead but the hair rose on his head and his blood stood still for it had turned with him and was behind him then  he had kept it before him that morning but it was behind nowalways  he leaned his back against a bank and felt that it stood above him visibly out against the cold nightsky  he threw himself upon the roadon his back upon the road  at his head it stood silent erect and stilla living gravestone with its epitaph in blood  let no man talk of murderers escaping justice and hint that providence must sleep  there were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute of that agony of fear  there was a shed in a field he passed that offered shelter for the night  before the door were three tall poplar trees which made it very dark within and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail he could not walk on till daylight came again and here he stretched himself close to the wallto undergo new torture  for now a vision came before him as constant and more terrible than that from which he had escaped  those widely staring eyes so lustreless and so glassy that he had better borne to see them than think upon them appeared in the midst of the darkness light in themselves but giving light to nothing  there were but two but they were everywhere  if he shut out the sight there came the room with every wellknown objectsome indeed that he would have forgotten if he had gone over its contents from memoryeach in its accustomed place  the body was in its place and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away  he got up and rushed into the field without  the figure was behind him he reentered the shed and shrunk down once more  the eyes were there before he had laid himself along  and here he remained in such terror as none but he can know trembling in every limb and the cold sweat starting from every pore when suddenly there arose upon the nightwind the noise of distant shouting and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder  any sound of men in that lonely place even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm was something to him  he regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal danger and springing to his feet rushed into the open air  the broad sky seemed on fire  rising into the air with showers of sparks and rolling one above the other were sheets of flame lighting the atmosphere for miles round and driving clouds of smoke in the direction where he stood  the shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar and he could hear the cry of fire mingled with the ringing of an alarmbell the fall of heavy bodies and the crackling of flames as they twined round some new obstacle and shot aloft as though refreshed by food  the noise increased as he looked  there were people theremen and womenlight bustle  it was like new life to him  he darted onwardstraight headlongdashing through brier and brake and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog who careered with loud and sounding bark before him  he came upon the spot  there were halfdressed figures tearing to and fro some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables others driving the cattle from the yard and outhouses and others coming laden from the burning pile amidst a shower of falling sparks and the tumbling down of redhot beams  the apertures where doors and windows stood an hour ago disclosed a mass of raging fire walls rocked and crumbled into the burning well the molten lead and iron poured down white hot upon the ground  women and children shrieked and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers  the clanking of the enginepumps and the spirting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood added to the tremendous roar  he shouted too till he was hoarse and flying from memory and himself plunged into the thickest of the throng  hither and thither he dived that night  now working at the pumps and now hurrying through the smoke and flame but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and men were thickest  up and down the ladders upon the roofs of buildings over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight under the lee of falling bricks and stones in every part of that great fire was he but he bore a charmed life and had neither scratch nor bruise nor weariness nor thought till morning dawned again and only smoke and blackened ruins remained  this mad excitement over there returned with tenfold force the dreadful consciousness of his crime  he looked suspiciously about him for the men were conversing in groups and he feared to be the subject of their talk  the dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger and they drew off stealthily together  he passed near an engine where some men were seated and they called to him to share in their refreshment  he took some bread and meat and as he drank a draught of beer heard the firemen who were from london talking about the murder  he has gone to birmingham they say said one  but theyll have him yet for the scouts are out and by tomorrow night therell be a cry all through the country  he hurried off and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground then lay down in a lane and had a long but broken and uneasy sleep  he wandered on again irresolute and undecided and oppressed with the fear of another solitary night  suddenly he took the desperate resolution to going back to london  theres somebody to speak to there at all event he thought a good hidingplace too  theyll never expect to nab me there after this country scent  why cant i lie by for a week or so and forcing blunt from fagin get abroad to france  damme ill risk it  he acted upon this impulse without delay and choosing the least frequented roads began his journey back resolved to lie concealed within a short distance of the metropolis and entering it at dusk by a circuitous route to proceed straight to that part of it which he had fixed on for his destination  the dog though  if any description of him were out it would not be forgotten that the dog was missing and had probably gone with him this might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets  he resolved to drown him and walked on looking about for a pond picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went  the animal looked up into his masters face while these preparations were making whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose or the robbers sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual and cowered as he came more slowly along  when his master halted at the brink of a pool and looked round to call him he stopped outright  do you hear me call  come here cried sikes  the animal came up from the very force of habit but as sikes stooped to attach the handkerchief to his throat he uttered a low growl and started back  come back said the robber  the dog wagged his tail but moved not  sikes made a running noose and called him again  the dog advanced retreated paused an instant and scoured away at his hardest speed  the man whistled again and again and sat down and waited in the expectation that he would return  but no dog appeared and at length he resumed his journey
