chapter which deserted a lady most unceremoniously  as it would be by no means seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting with his back to the fire and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him and as it would still less become his station or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words which coming from such a quarter might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree the historian whose pen traces these wordstrusting that he knows his place and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegatedhastens to pay them that respect which their position demands and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank and by consequence great virtues imperatively claim at his hands  towards this end indeed he had purposed to introduce in this place a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles and elucidative of the position that a beadle can do no wrong  which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the rightminded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled by want of time and space to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity on the arrival of which he will be prepared to show that a beadle properly constituted  that is to say a parochial beadle attached to a parochial workhouse and attending in his official capacity the parochial church  is in right and virtue of his office possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity and that to none of those excellences can mere companies beadles or courtoflaw beadles or even chapelofease beadles save the last and they in a very lowly and inferior degree lay the remotest sustainable claim  mr bumble had recounted the teaspoons reweighed the sugartongs made a closer inspection of the milkpot and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture down to the very horsehair seats of the chairs and had repeated each process full half a dozen times before he began to think that it was time for mrs corney to return thinking begets thinking as there were no sounds of mrs corneys approach it occured to mr bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of mrs corneys chest of drawers  having listened at the keyhole to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber mr bumble beginning at the bottom proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers which being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers speckled with dried lavender seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction  arriving in course of time at the righthand corner drawer in which was the key and beholding therein a small padlocked box which being shaken gave forth a pleasant sound as of the chinking of coin mr bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace and resuming his old attitude said with a grave and determined air ill do it he followed up this remarkable declaration by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog and then he took a view of his legs in profile with much seeming pleasure and interest  he was still placidly engaged in this latter survey when mrs corney hurrying into the room threw herself in a breathless state on a chair by the fireside and covering her eyes with one hand placed the other over her heart and gasped for breath  mrs corney said mr bumble stooping over the matron what is this maam  has anything happened maam  pray answer me im onon mr bumble in his alarm could not immediately think of the word tenterhooks so he said broken bottles  oh mr bumble cried the lady i have been so dreadfully put out  put out maam exclaimed mr bumble who has dared to  i know said mr bumble checking himself with native majesty this is them wicious paupers  its dreadful to think of said the lady shuddering  then dont think of it maam rejoined mr bumble  i cant help it whimpered the lady  then take something maam said mr bumble soothingly  a little of the wine  not for the world replied mrs corney  i couldntoh  the top shelf in the righthand corneroh  uttering these words the good lady pointed distractedly to the cupboard and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms  mr bumble rushed to the closet and snatching a pint greenglass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated filled a teacup with its contents and held it to the ladys lips  im better now said mrs corney falling back after drinking half of it  mr bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness and bringing them down again to the brim of the cup lifted it to his nose  peppermint exclaimed mrs corney in a faint voice smiling gently on the beadle as she spoke  try it  theres a littlea little something else in it  mr bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look smacked his lips took another taste and put the cup down empty  its very comforting said mrs corney  very much so indeed maam said the beadle  as he spoke he drew a chair beside the matron and tenderly inquired what had happened to distress her  nothing replied mrs corney  i am a foolish excitable weak creetur  not weak maam retorted mr bumble drawing his chair a little closer  are you a weak creetur mrs corney  we are all weak creeturs said mrs corney laying down a general principle  so we are said the beadle  nothing was said on either side for a minute or two afterwards by the expiration of that time mr bumble had illustrated the position by removing his left arm from the back of mrs corneys chair where it had previously rested to mrs corneys apronstring round which it gradually became entwined  we are all weak creeturs said mr bumble  mrs corney sighed  dont sigh mrs corney said mr bumble  i cant help it said mrs corney  and she sighed again  this is a very comfortable room maam said mr bumble looking round  another room and this maam would be a complete thing  it would be too much for one murmured the lady  but not for two maam rejoined mr bumble in soft accents eh mrs corney  mrs corney drooped her head when the beadle said this the beadle drooped his to get a view of mrs corneys face  mrs corney with great propriety turned her head away and released her hand to get at her pockethandkerchief but insensibly replaced it in that of mr bumble  the board allows you coals dont they mrs corney inquired the beadle affectionately pressing her hand  and candles replied mrs corney slightly returning the pressure  coals candles and houserent free said mr bumble  oh mrs corney what an angel you are  the lady was not proof against this burst of feeling  she sank into mr bumbles arms and that gentleman in his agitation imprinted a passionate kiss upon her chaste nose  such porochial perfection exclaimed mr bumble rapturously you know that mr slout is worse tonight my fascinator  yes replied mrs corney bashfully  he cant live a week the doctor says pursued mr bumble he is the master of this establishment his death will cause a wacancy that wacancy must be filled up  oh mrs corney what a prospect this opens  what a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings  mrs corney sobbed  the little word said mr bumble bending over the bashful beauty the one little little little word my blessed corney  yeyeyes sighed out the matron  one more pursued the beadle compose your darling feelings for only one more  when is it to come off  mrs corney twice essayed to speak  and twice failed  at length summoning up courage she threw her arms around mr bumbles neck and said it might be as soon as ever he pleased and that he was a irresistible duck  matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged the contract was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture which was rendered the more necessary by the flutter and agitation of the ladys spirits  while it was being disposed of she acquainted mr bumble with the old womans decease  very good said that gentleman sipping his peppermint ill call at sowerberrys as i go home and tell him to send tomorrow morning  was it that as frightened you love  it wasnt anything particular dear said the lady evasively  it must have been something love urged mr bumble wont you tell your own b  not now rejoined the lady one of these days  after were married dear  after were married exclaimed mr bumble  it wasnt any impudence from any of them male paupers as  no no love interposed the lady hastily  if i thought it was continued mr bumble if i thought as any one of em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance  they wouldnt have dared to do it love responded the lady  they had better not said mr bumble clenching his fist let me see any man porochial or extraporochial as would presume to do it and i can tell him that he wouldnt do it a second time  unembellished by any violence of gesticulation this might have seemed no very high compliment to the ladys charms but as mr bumble accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures she was much touched with this proof of his devotion and protested with great admiration that he was indeed a dove  the dove then turned up his coatcollar and put on his cocked hat and having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner once again braved the cold wind of the night merely pausing for a few minutes in the male paupers ward to abuse them a little with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhousemaster with needful acerbity assured of his qualifications mr bumble left the building with a light heart and bright visions of his future promotion  which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker  now mr and mrs sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper and noah claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking the shop was not closed although it was past the usual hour of shuttingup  mr bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times but attracting no attention and beholding a light shining through the glasswindow of the little parlour at the back of the shop he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward and when he saw what was going forward he was not a little surprised  the cloth was laid for supper the table was covered with bread and butter plates and glasses a porterpot and a winebottle at the upper end of the table mr noah claypole lolled negligently in an easychair with his legs thrown over one of the arms an open claspknife in one hand and a mass of buttered bread in the other close beside him stood charlotte opening oysters from a barrel which mr claypole condescended to swallow with remarkable avidity  a more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentlemans nose and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties in cases of internal fever could have sufficiently accounted  heres a delicious fat one noah dear said charlotte try him do only this one  what a delicious thing is a oyster remarked mr claypole after he had swallowed it  what a pity it is a number of em should ever make you feel uncomfortable isnt it charlotte  its quite a cruelty said charlotte  so it is acquiesced mr claypole ant yer fond of oysters  not overmuch replied charlotte  i like to see you eat em noah dear better than eating em myself  lor said noah reflectively how queer  have another said charlotte  heres one with such a beautiful delicate beard  i cant manage any more said noah  im very sorry  come here charlotte and ill kiss yer  what said mr bumble bursting into the room  say that again sir  charlotte uttered a scream and hid her face in her apron  mr claypole without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs to reach the ground gazed at the beadle in drunken terror  say it again you wile owdacious fellow said mr bumble how dare you mention such a thing sir  and how dare you encourage him you insolent minx  kiss her exclaimed mr bumble in strong indignation faugh  i didnt mean to do it said noah blubbering  shes always akissing of me whether i like it or not  oh noah cried charlotte reproachfully  yer are yer know yer are retorted noah  shes always adoin of it mr bumble sir she chucks me under the chin please sir and makes all manner of love  silence cried mr bumble sternly  take yourself downstairs maam  noah you shut up the shop say another word till your master comes home at your peril and when he does come home tell him that mr bumble said he was to send a old womans shell after breakfast tomorrow morning  do you hear sir  kissing cried mr bumble holding up his hands  the sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful  if parliament dont take their abominable courses under consideration this countrys ruined and the character of the peasantry gone for ever  with these words the beadle strode with a lofty and gloomy air from the undertakers premises  and now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home and have made all necessary preparations for the old womans funeral let us set on foot a few inquires after young oliver twist and ascertain whether he be still lying in the ditch where toby crackit left him
