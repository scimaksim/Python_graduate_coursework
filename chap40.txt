chapter xxxviii  containing an account of what passed between mr and mrs bumble and mr monks at their nocturnal interview  it was a dull close overcast summer evening  the clouds which had been threatening all day spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour already yielded large drops of rain and seemed to presage a violent thunderstorm when mr and mrs bumble turning out of the main street of the town directed their course towards a scattered little colony of ruinous houses distant from it some mile and ahalf or thereabouts and erected on a low unwholesome swamp bordering upon the river  they were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments which might perhaps serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the rain and sheltering them from observation  the husband carried a lantern from which however no light yet shone and trudged on a few paces in front as thoughthe way being dirtyto give his wife the benefit of treading in his heavy footprints  they went on in profound silence every now and then mr bumble relaxed his pace and turned his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following then discovering that she was close at his heels he mended his rate of walking and proceeded at a considerable increase of speed towards their place of destination  this was far from being a place of doubtful character for it had long been known as the residence of none but low ruffians who under various pretences of living by their labour subsisted chiefly on plunder and crime  it was a collection of mere hovels  some hastily built with loose bricks others of old wormeaten shiptimber jumbled together without any attempt at order or arrangement and planted for the most part within a few feet of the rivers bank  a few leaky boats drawn up on the mud and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it  and here and there an oar or coil of rope  appeared at first to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the river but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles thus displayed would have led a passerby without much difficulty to the conjecture that they were disposed there rather for the preservation of appearances than with any view to their being actually employed  in the heart of this cluster of huts and skirting the river which its upper stories overhung stood a large building formerly used as a manufactory of some kind  it had in its day probably furnished employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements  but it had long since gone to ruin  the rat the worm and the action of the damp had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood and a considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the water while the remainder tottering and bending over the dark stream seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion and involving itself in the same fate  it was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused as the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air and the rain commenced pouring violently down  the place should be somewhere here said bumble consulting a scrap of paper he held in his hand  halloa there cried a voice from above  following the sound mr bumble raised his head and descried a man looking out of a door breasthigh on the second story  stand still a minute cried the voice ill be with you directly with which the head disappeared and the door closed  is that the man asked mr bumbles good lady  mr bumble nodded in the affirmative  then mind what i told you said the matron and be careful to say as little as you can or youll betray us at once  mr bumble who had eyed the building with very rueful looks was apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of proceeding any further with the enterprise just then when he was prevented by the appearance of monks who opened a small door near which they stood and beckoned them inwards  come in he cried impatiently stamping his foot upon the ground dont keep me here  the woman who had hesitated at first walked boldly in without any other invitation  mr bumble who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind followed  obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic  what the devil made you stand lingering there in the wet said monks turning round and addressing bumble after he had bolted the door behind them  wewe were only cooling ourselves stammered bumble looking apprehensively about him  cooling yourselves retorted monks  not all the rain that ever fell or ever will fall will put as much of hells fire out as a man can carry about with him  you wont cool yourself so easily dont think it  with this agreeable speech monks turned short upon the matron and bent his gaze upon her till even she who was not easily cowed was fain to withdraw her eyes and turn them towards the ground  this is the woman is it demanded monks  hem  that is the woman replied mr bumble mindful of his wifes caution  you think women never can keep secrets i suppose said the matron interposing and returning as she spoke the searching look of monks  i know they will always keep one till its found out said monks  and what may that be asked the matron  the loss of their own good name replied monks  so by the same rule if a womans a party to a secret that might hang or transport her im not afraid of her telling it to anybody not i  do you understand mistress  no rejoined the matron slightly colouring as she spoke  of course you dont said monks  how should you  bestowing something halfway between a smile and a frown upon his two companions and again beckoning them to follow him the man hastened across the apartment which was of considerable extent but low in the roof  he was preparing to ascend a steep staircase or rather ladder leading to another floor of warehouses above  when a bright flash of lightning streamed down the aperture and a peal of thunder followed which shook the crazy building to its centre  hear it he cried shrinking back  hear it  rolling and crashing on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from it  i hate the sound  he remained silent for a few moments and then removing his hands suddenly from his face showed to the unspeakable discomposure of mr bumble that it was much distorted and discoloured  these fits come over me now and then said monks observing his alarm and thunder sometimes brings them on dont mind me now its all over for this once  thus speaking he led the way up the ladder and hastily closing the windowshutter of the room into which it led lowered a lantern which hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in the ceiling  and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs that were placed beneath it  now said monks when they had all three seated themselves the sooner we come to our business the better for all  the woman know what it is does she  the question was addressed to bumble but his wife anticipated the reply by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it  he is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died and that she told you something  about the mother of the boy you named replied the matron interrupting him  yes  the first question is of what nature was her communication said monks  thats the second observed the woman with much deliberation the first is what may the communication be worth  who the devil can tell that without knowing of what kind it is asked monks  nobody better than you i am persuaded answered mrs bumble who did not want for spirit as her yokefellow could abundantly testify  humph said monks significantly and with a look of eager inquiry there may be moneys worth to get eh  perhaps there may was the composed reply  something that was taken from her said monks  something that she wore  something that  you had better bid interrupted mrs bumble  i have heard enough already to assure me that you are the man i ought to talk to  mr bumble who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed listened to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes  which he directed towards his wife and monks by turns in undisguised astonishment increased if possible when the latter sternly demanded what sum was required for the disclosure  whats it worth to you asked the woman as collectedly as before  it may be nothing it may be twenty pounds replied monks speak out and let me know which  add five pounds to the sum you have named give me fiveandtwenty pounds in gold said the woman and ill tell you all i know  not before  fiveandtwenty pounds exclaimed monks drawing back  i spoke as plainly as i could replied mrs bumble  its not a large sum either  not a large sum for a paltry secret that may be nothing when its told cried monks impatiently and which has been lying dead for twelve years past or more  such matters keep well and like good wine often double their value in course of time answered the matron still preserving the resolute indifference she had assumed  as to lying dead there are those who will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come or twelve million for anything you or i know who will tell strange tales at last  what if i pay it for nothing asked monks hesitating  you can easily take it away again replied the matron i am but a woman alone here and unprotected  not alone my dear nor unprotected neither submitted mr bumble in a voice tremulous with fear i am here my dear and besides said mr bumble his teeth chattering as he spoke mr monks is too much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons  mr monks is aware that i am not a young man my dear and also that i am a little run to seed as i may say bu he has heerd  i say i have no doubt mr monks has heerd my dear  that i am a very determined officer with very uncommon strength if im once roused  i only want a little rousing thats all  as mr bumble spoke he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern with fierce determination and plainly showed by the alarmed expression of every feature that he did want a little rousing and not a little prior to making any very warlike demonstration unless indeed against paupers or other person or persons trained down for the purpose  you are a fool said mrs bumble in reply and had better hold your tongue  he had better have cut it out before he came if he cant speak in a lower tone said monks grimly  so  hes your husband eh  he my husband tittered the matron parrying the question  i thought as much when you came in rejoined monks marking the angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke  so much the better i have less hesitation in dealing with two people when i find that theres only one will between them  im in earnest see here  he thrust his hand into a sidepocket and producing a canvas bag told out twentyfive sovereigns on the table and pushed them over to the woman  now he said gather them up and when this cursed peal of thunder which i feel is coming up to break over the housetop is gone lets hear your story  the thunder which seemed in fact much nearer and to shiver and break almost over their heads having subsided monks raising his face from the table bent forward to listen to what the woman should say  the faces of the three nearly touched as the two men leant over the small table in their eagerness to hear and the woman also leant forward to render her whisper audible  the sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly upon them aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances which encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness looked ghastly in the extreme  when this woman that we called old sally died the matron began she and i were alone  was there no one by asked monks in the same hollow whisper no sick wretch or idiot in some other bed  no one who could hear and might by possibility understand  not a soul replied the woman we were alone  i stood alone beside the body when death came over it  good said monks regarding her attentively  go on  she spoke of a young creature resumed the matron who had brought a child into the world some years before not merely in the same room but in the same bed in which she then lay dying  ay said monks with quivering lip and glancing over his shoulder blood  how things come about  the child was the one you named to him last night said the matron nodding carelessly towards her husband the mother this nurse had robbed  in life asked monks  in death replied the woman with something like a shudder she stole from the corpse when it had hardly turned to one that which the dead mother had prayed her with her last breath to keep for the infants sake  she sold it cried monks with desperate eagerness did she sell it where  when  to whom  how long before  as she told me with great difficulty that she had done this said the matron she fell back and died  without saying more cried monks in a voice which from its very suppression seemed only the more furious  its a lie ill not be played with  she said more  ill tear the life out of you both but ill know what it was  she didnt utter another word said the woman to all appearance unmoved as mr bumble was very far from being by the strange mans violence but she clutched my gown violently with one hand which was partly closed and when i saw that she was dead and so removed the hand by force i found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper  which contained interposed monks stretching forward  nothing replied the woman it was a pawnbrokers duplicate  for what demanded monks  in good time ill tell you said the woman  i judge that she had kept the trinket for some time in the hope of turning it to better account and then had pawned it and had saved or scraped together money to pay the pawnbrokers interest year by year and prevent its running out so that if anything came of it it could still be redeemed  nothing had come of it and as i tell you she died with the scrap of paper all worn and tattered in her hand  the time was out in two days i thought something might one day come of it too and so redeemed the pledge  where is it now asked monks quickly  there replied the woman  and as if glad to be relieved of it she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for a french watch which monks pouncing upon tore open with trembling hands  it contained a little gold locket in which were two locks of hair and a plain gold weddingring  it has the word agnes engraved on the inside said the woman  there is a blank left for the surname and then follows the date which is within a year before the child was born  i found out that  and this is all said monks after a close and eager scrutiny of the contents of the little packet  all replied the woman  mr bumble drew a long breath as if he were glad to find that the story was over and no mention made of taking the fiveandtwenty pounds back again and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been trickling over his nose unchecked during the whole of the previous dialogue  i know nothing of the story beyond what i can guess at said his wife addressing monks after a short silence and i want to know nothing for its safer not  but i may ask you two questions may i  you may ask said monks with some show of surprise but whether i answer or not is another question  which makes three observed mr bumble essaying a stroke of facetiousness  is that what you expected to get from me demanded the matron  it is replied monks  the other question  what do you propose to do with it  can it be used against me  never rejoined monks nor against me either  see here  but dont move a step forward or your life is not worth a bulrush  with these words he suddenly wheeled the table aside and pulling an iron ring in the boarding threw back a large trapdoor which opened close at mr bumbles feet and caused that gentleman to retire several paces backward with great precipitation  look down said monks lowering the lantern into the gulf dont fear me  i could have let you down quietly enough when you were seated over it if that had been my game  thus encouraged the matron drew near to the brink and even mr bumble himself impelled by curiousity ventured to do the same the turbid water swollen by the heavy rain was rushing rapidly on below and all other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against the green and slimy piles  there had once been a watermill beneath the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes and fragments of machinery that yet remained seemed to dart onward with a new impulse when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its headlong course  if you flung a mans body down there where would it be tomorrow morning said monks swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well  twelve miles down the river and cut to pieces besides replied bumble recoiling at the thought  monks drew the little packet from his breast where he had hurriedly thrust it and tying it to a leaden weight which had formed a part of some pulley and was lying on the floor dropped it into the stream it fell straight and true as a die clove the water with a scarcely audible splash and was gone  the three looking into each others faces seemed to breathe more freely  there said monks closing the trapdoor which fell heavily back into its former position  if the sea ever gives up its dead as books say it will it will keep its gold and silver to itself and that trash among it  we have nothing more to say and may break up our pleasant party  by all means observed mr bumble with great alacrity  youll keep a quiet tongue in your head will you said monks with a threatening look  i am not afraid of your wife  you may depend upon me young man answered mr bumble bowing himself gradually towards the ladder with excessive politeness on everybodys account young man on my own you know mr monks  i am glad for your sake to hear it remarked monks light your lantern  and get away from here as fast as you can  it was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point or mr bumble who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder would infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below  he lighted his lantern from that which monks had detached from the rope and now carried in his hand and making no effort to prolong the discourse descended in silence followed by his wife  monks brought up the rear after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without and the rushing of the water  they traversed the lower room slowly and with caution for monks started at every shadow and mr bumble holding his lantern a foot above the ground walked not only with remarkable care but with a marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure  looking nervously about him for hidden trapdoors  the gate at which they had entered was softly unfastened and opened by monks merely exchanging a nod with their mysterious acquaintance the married couple emerged into the wet and darkness outside  they were no sooner gone than monks who appeared to entertain an invincible repugnance to being left alone called to a boy who had been hidden somewhere below bidding him go first and bear the light he returned to the chamber he had just quitted
