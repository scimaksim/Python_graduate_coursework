chapter xxxiii  wherein the happiness of oliver and his friends experiences a sudden check  spring flew swiftly by and summer came  if the village had been beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness  the great trees which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months had now burst into strong life and health and stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground converted open and naked spots into choice nooks where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the wide prospect steeped in sunshine which lay stretched beyond  the earth had donned her mantle of brightest green and shed her richest perfumes abroad  it was the prime and vigour of the year all things were glad and flourishing  still the same quiet life went on at the little cottage and the same cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates  oliver had long since grown stout and healthy but health or sickness made no difference in his warm feelings of a great many people  he was still the same gentle attached affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted his strength and when he was dependent for every slight attention and comfort on those who tended him  one beautiful night when they had taken a longer walk than was customary with them  for the day had been unusually warm and there was a brilliant moon and a light wind had sprung up which was unusually refreshing  rose had been in high spirits too and they had walked on in merry conversation until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds  mrs maylie being fatigued they returned more slowly home  the young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet sat down to the piano as usual  after running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes she fell into a low and very solemn air and as she played it they heard a sound as if she were weeping  rose my dear said the elder lady  rose made no reply but played a little quicker as though the words had roused her from some painful thoughts  rose my love cried mrs maylie rising hastily and bending over her  what is this  in tears  my dear child what distresses you  nothing aunt nothing replied the young lady  i dont know what it is i cant describe it but i feel  not ill my love interposed mrs maylie  no no  oh not ill replied rose shuddering as though some deadly chillness were passing over her while she spoke i shall be better presently  close the window pray  oliver hastened to comply with her request  the young lady making an effort to recover her cheerfulness strove to play some livelier tune but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys covering her face with her hands she sank upon a sofa and gave vent to the tears which she was now unable to repress  my child said the elderly lady folding her arms about her i never saw you so before  i would not alarm you if i could avoid it rejoined rose but indeed i have tried very hard and cannot help this i fear i am ill aunt  she was indeed for when candles were brought they saw that in the very short time which had elapsed since their return home the hue of her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness its expression had lost nothing of its beauty but it was changed and there was an anxious haggard look about the gentle face which it had never worn before  another minute and it was suffused with a crimson flush  and a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye  again this disappeared like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud and she was once more deadly pale  oliver who watched the old lady anxiously observed that she was alarmed by these appearances and so in truth was he but seeing that she affected to make light of them he endeavoured to do the same and they so far succeeded that when rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the night she was in better spirits and appeared even in better health  assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning quite well  i hope said oliver when mrs maylie returned that nothing is the matter  she dont look well tonight but  the old lady motioned to him not to speak and sitting herself down in a dark corner of the room remained silent for some time at length she said in a trembling voice  i hope not oliver  i have been very happy with her for some years too happy perhaps  it may be time that i should meet with some misfortune but i hope it is not this  what inquired oliver  the heavy blow said the old lady of losing the dear girl who has so long been my comfort and happiness  oh  god forbid exclaimed oliver hastily  amen to that my child said the old lady wringing her hands  surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful said oliver two hours ago she was quite well  she is very ill now rejoined mrs maylies and will be worse i am sure  my dear dear rose  oh what shall i do without her  she gave way to such great grief that oliver suppressing his own emotion ventured to remonstrate with her and to beg earnestly that for the sake of the dear young lady herself she would be more calm  and consider maam said oliver as the tears forced themselves into his eyes despite of his efforts to the contrary oh consider how young and good she is and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her  i am surecertainquite certainthat for your sake who are so good yourself and for her own and for the sake of all she makes so happy she will not die  heaven will never let her die so young  hush said mrs maylie laying her hand on olivers head you think like a child poor boy  but you teach me my duty notwithstanding  i had forgotten it for a moment oliver but i hope i may be pardoned for i am old and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of separation from the objects of our love  i have seen enough too to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that love them but this should give us comfort in our sorrow for heaven is just and such things teach us impressively that there is a brighter world than this and that the passage to it is speedy gods will be done  i love her and he knows how well  oliver was surprised to see that as mrs maylie said these words she checked her lamentations as though by one effort and drawing herself up as she spoke became composed and firm  he was still more astonished to find that this firmness lasted and that under all the care and watching which ensued mrs maylie was every ready and collected performing all the duties which had devolved upon her steadily and to all external appearances even cheerfully  but he was young and did not know what strong minds are capable of under trying circumstances  how should he when their possessors so seldom know themselves  an anxious night ensued  when morning came mrs maylies predictions were but too well verified  rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous fever  we must be active oliver and not give way to useless grief said mrs maylie laying her finger on her lip as she looked steadily into his face this letter must be sent with all possible expedition to mr losberne  it must be carried to the markettown which is not more than four miles off by the footpath across the field  and thence dispatched by an express on horseback straight to chertsey the people at the inn will undertake to do this and i can trust to you to see it done i know  oliver could make no reply but looked his anxiety to be gone at once  here is another letter said mrs maylie pausing to reflect but whether to send it now or wait until i see how rose goes on i scarcely know  i would not forward it unless i feared the worst  is it for chertsey too maam inquired oliver impatient to execute his commission and holding out his trembling hand for the letter  no replied the old lady giving it to him mechanically oliver glanced at it and saw that it was directed to harry maylie esquire at some great lords house in the country where he could not make out  shall it go maam asked oliver looking up impatiently  i think not replied mrs maylie taking it back  i will wait until tomorrow  with these words she gave oliver her purse and he started off without more delay at the greatest speed he could muster  swiftly he ran across the fields and down the little lanes which sometimes divided them now almost hidden by the high corn on either side and now emerging on an open field where the mowers and haymakers were busy at their work  nor did he stop once save now and then for a few seconds to recover breath until he came in a great heat and covered with dust on the little marketplace of the markettown  here he paused and looked about for the inn  there were a white bank and a red brewery and a yellow townhall and in one corner there was a large house with all the wood about it painted green  before which was the sign of the george  to this he hastened as soon as it caught his eye  he spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway and who after hearing what he wanted referred him to the ostler who after hearing all he had to say again referred him to the landlord who was a tall gentleman in a blue neckcloth a white hat drab breeches and boots with tops to match leaning against a pump by the stabledoor picking his teeth with a silver toothpick  this gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the bill  which took a long time making out  and after it was ready and paid a horse had to be saddled and a man to be dressed which took up ten good minutes more  meanwhile oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience and anxiety that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse himself and galloped away full tear to the next stage  at length all was ready and the little parcel having been handed up with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery the man set spurs to his horse and rattling over the uneven paving of the marketplace was out of the town and galloping along the turnpikeroad in a couple of minutes  as it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for and that no time had been lost oliver hurried up the innyard with a somewhat lighter heart  he was turning out of the gateway when he accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak who was at that moment coming out of the inn door  hah cried the man fixing his eyes on oliver and suddenly recoiling  what the devils this  i beg your pardon sir said oliver i was in a great hurry to get home and didnt see you were coming  death muttered the man to himself glaring at the boy with his large dark eyes  who would have thought it grind him to ashes hed start up from a stone coffin to come in my way  i am sorry stammered oliver confused by the strange mans wild look  i hope i have not hurt you  rot you murmured the man in a horrible passion between his clenched teeth if i had only had the courage to say the word i might have been free of you in a night  curses on your head and black death on your heart you imp  what are you doing here  the man shook his fist as he uttered these words incoherently he advanced towards oliver as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him but fell violently on the ground  writhing and foaming in a fit  oliver gazed for a moment at the struggles of the madman for such he supposed him to be and then darted into the house for help  having seen him safely carried into the hotel he turned his face homewards running as fast as he could to make up for lost time  and recalling with a great deal of astonishment and some fear the extraordinary behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted  the circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long however for when he reached the cottage there was enough to occupy his mind and to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory  rose maylie had rapidly grown worse before midnight she was delirious  a medical practitioner who resided on the spot was in constant attendance upon her and after first seeing the patient he had taken mrs maylie aside and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature in fact he said it would be little short of a miracle if she recovered  how often did oliver start from his bed that night and stealing out with noiseless footstep to the staircase listen for the slightest sound from the sick chamber  how often did a tremble shake his frame and cold drops of terror start upon his brow when a sudden trampling of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of had even then occurred  and what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered compared with those he poured forth now in the agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature who was tottering on the deep graves verge  oh the suspense the fearful acute suspense of standing idly by while the life of one we dearly love is trembling in the balance  oh the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind and make the heart beat violently and the breath come thick by the force of the images they conjure up before it the desperate anxiety to be doing something to relieve the pain or lessen the danger which we have no power to alleviate the sinking of soul and spirit which the sad remembrance of our helplessness produces what tortures can equal these what reflections or endeavours can in the full tide and fever of the time allay them  morning came and the little cottage was lonely and still people spoke in whispers anxious faces appeared at the gate from time to time women and children went away in tears all the livelong day and for hours after it had grown dark oliver paced softly up and down the garden raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber and shuddering to see the darkened window looking as if death lay stretched inside  late that night mr losberne arrived  it is hard said the good doctor turning away as he spoke so young so much beloved but there is very little hope  another morning  the sun shone brightly as brightly as if it looked upon no misery or care and with every leaf and flower in full bloom about her with life and health and sounds and sights of joy surrounding her on every side the fair young creature lay wasting fast  oliver crept away to the old churchyard and sitting down on one of the green mounds wept and prayed for her in silence  there was such peace and beauty in the scene so much of brightness and mirth in the sunny landscape such blithesome music in the songs of the summer birds such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook careering overhead so much of life and joyousness in all that when the boy raised his aching eyes and looked about the thought instinctively occurred to him that this was not a time for death that rose could surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay that graves were for cold and cheerless winter  not for sunlight and fragrance he almost thought that shrouds were for the old and shrunken and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds  a knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts another  again  it was tolling for the funeral service  a group of humble mourners entered the gate wearing white favours for the corpse was young  they stood uncovered by a grave and there was a mothera mother onceamong the weeping train  but the sun shone brightly and the birds sang on  oliver turned homeward thinking on the many kindnesses he had received from the young lady and wishing that the time could come again that he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was  he had no cause for selfreproach on the score of neglect or want of thought for he had been devoted to her service and yet a hundred little occasions rose up before him on which he fancied he might have been more zealous and more earnest and wished he had been  we need be careful how we deal with those about us when every death carries to some small circle of survivors thoughts of so much omitted and so little doneof so many things forgotten and so many more which might have been repaired  there is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing if we would be spared its tortures let us remember this in time  when he reached home mrs maylie was sitting in the little parlour olivers heart sank at sight of her for she had never left the bedside of her niece and he trembled to think what change could have driven her away  he learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep from which she would waken either to recovery and life or to bid them farewell and die  they sat listening and afraid to speak for hours  the untasted meal was removed with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower and at length cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure  their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep  they both involuntarily darted to the door as mr losberne entered  what of rose cried the old lady  tell me at once  i can bear it anything but suspense  oh tell me in the name of heaven  you must compose yourself said the doctor supporting her be calm my dear maam pray  let me go in gods name  my dear child  she is dead she is dying  no cried the doctor passionately  as he is good and merciful she will live to bless us all for years to come  the lady fell upon her knees and tried to fold her hands together but the energy which had supported her so long fled up to heaven with her first thanksgiving and she sank into the friendly arms which were extended to receive her
