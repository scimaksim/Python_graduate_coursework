chapter xvi  relates what became of oliver twist after he had been claimed by nancy  the narrow streets and courts at length terminated in a large open space scattered about which were pens for beasts and other indications of a cattlemarket  sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot  the girl being quite unable to support any longer the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked  turning to oliver he roughly commanded him to take hold of nancys hand  do you hear growled sikes as oliver hesitated and looked round  they were in a dark corner quite out of the track of passengers  oliver saw but too plainly that resistance would be of no avail  he held out his hand which nancy clasped tight in hers  give me the other said sikes seizing olivers unoccupied hand here bullseye  the dog looked up and growled  see here boy said sikes putting his other hand to olivers throat if he speaks ever so soft a word hold him  dye mind  the dog growled again and licking his lips eyed oliver as if he were anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay  hes as willing as a christian strike me blind if he isnt said sikes regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval now you know what youve got to expect master so call away as quick as you like the dog will soon stop that game  get on youngun  bullseye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing form of speech and giving vent to another admonitory growl for the benefit of oliver led the way onward  it was smithfield that they were crossing although it might have been grosvenor square for anything oliver knew to the contrary the night was dark and foggy  the lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through the heavy mist which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and houses in gloom rendering the strange place still stranger in olivers eyes and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing  they had hurried on a few paces when a deep churchbell struck the hour  with its first stroke his two conductors stopped and turned their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded  eight o clock bill said nancy when the bell ceased  whats the good of telling me that i can hear it cant i replied sikes  i wonder whether they can hear it said nancy  of course they can replied sikes  it was bartlemy time when i was shopped and there warnt a penny trumpet in the fair as i couldnt hear the squeaking on  arter i was locked up for the night the row and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent that i could almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door  poor fellow said nancy who still had her face turned towards the quarter in which the bell had sounded  oh bill such fine young chaps as them  yes thats all you women think of answered sikes  fine young chaps  well theyre as good as dead so it dont much matter  with this consolation mr sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to jealousy and clasping olivers wrist more firmly told him to step out again  wait a minute said the girl  i wouldnt hurry by if it was you that was coming out to be hung the next time eight oclock struck bill  id walk round and round the place till i dropped if the snow was on the ground and i hadnt a shawl to cover me  and what good would that do inquired the unsentimental mr sikes unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope you might as well be walking fifty mile off or not walking at all for all the good it would do me  come on and dont stand preaching there  the girl burst into a laugh drew her shawl more closely round her and they walked away  but oliver felt her hand tremble and looking up in her face as they passed a gaslamp saw that it had turned a deadly white  they walked on by littlefrequented and dirty ways for a full halfhour  meeting very few people and those appearing from their looks to hold much the same position in society as mr sikes himself at length they turned into a very filthy narrow street nearly full of oldclothes shops the dog running forward as if conscious that there was no further occasion for his keeping on guard stopped before the door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted the house was in a ruinous condition and on the door was nailed a board intimating that it was to let  which looked as if it had hung there for many years  all right cried sikes glancing cautiously about  nancy stooped below the shutters and oliver heard the sound of a bell they crossed to the opposite side of the street and stood for a few moments under a lamp  a noise as if a sash window were gently raised was heard and soon afterwards the door softly opened  mr sikes then seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony and all three were quickly inside the house  the passage was perfectly dark  they waited while the person who had let them in chained and barred the door  anybody here inquired sikes  no replied a voice which oliver thought he had heard before  is the old un here asked the robber  yes replied the voice and precious down in the mouth he has been wont he be glad to see you  oh no  the style of this reply as well as the voice which delivered it seemed familiar to olivers ears  but it was impossible to distinguish even the form of the speaker in the darkness  lets have a glim said sikes or we shall go breaking our necks or treading on the dog  look after your legs if you do  stand still a moment and ill get you one replied the voice the receding footsteps of the speaker were heard and in another minute the form of mr john dawkins otherwise the artful dodger appeared he bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick  the young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition upon oliver than a humourous grin but turning away beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs they crossed an empty kitchen and opening the door of a low earthysmelling room which seemed to have been built in a small backyard were received with a shout of laughter  oh my wig my wig cried master charles bates from whose lungs the laughter had proceeded  here he is oh cry here he is  oh fagin look at him  fagin do look at him i cant bear it it is such a jolly game i cant bear it  hold me somebody while i laugh it out  with this irrepressible ebullition of mirth master bates laid himself flat on the floor and kicked convulsively for five minutes in an ectasy of facetious joy  then jumping to his feet he snatched the cleft stick from the dodger and advancing to oliver viewed him round and round while the jew taking off his nightcap made a great number of low bows to the bewildered boy  the artful meantime who was of a rather saturnine disposition and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with business rifled olivers pockets with steady assiduity  look at his togs fagin said charley putting the light so close to his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire  look at his togs superfine cloth and the heavy swell cut  oh my eye what a game and his books too  nothing but a gentleman fagin  delighted to see you looking so well my dear said the jew bowing with mock humility  the artful shall give you another suit my dear for fear you should spoil that sunday one  why didnt you write my dear and say you were coming  wed have got something warm for supper  at his master bates roared again so loud that fagin himself relaxed and even the dodger smiled but as the artful drew forth the fivepound note at that instant it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery awakened his merriment  hallo whats that inquired sikes stepping forward as the jew seized the note  thats mine fagin  no no my dear said the jew  mine bill mine  you shall have the books  if that aint mine said bill sikes putting on his hat with a determined air mine and nancys that is ill take the boy back again  the jew started  oliver started too though from a very different cause for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back  come  hand over will you said sikes  this is hardly fair bill hardly fair is it nancy inquired the jew  fair or not fair retorted sikes hand over i tell you do you think nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to spend it in scouting arter and kidnapping every young boy as gets grabbed through you  give it here you avaricious old skeleton give it here  with this gentle remonstrance mr sikes plucked the note from between the jews finger and thumb and looking the old man coolly in the face folded it up small and tied it in his neckerchief  thats for our share of the trouble said sikes and not half enough neither  you may keep the books if youre fond of reading if you aint sell em  theyre very pretty said charley bates who with sundry grimaces had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question beautiful writing isnt is oliver  at sight of the dismayed look with which oliver regarded his tormentors master bates who was blessed with a lively sense of the ludicrous fell into another ectasy more boisterous than the first  they belong to the old gentleman said oliver wringing his hands to the good kind old gentleman who took me into his house and had me nursed when i was near dying of the fever oh pray send them back send him back the books and money  keep me here all my life long but pray pray send them back  hell think i stole them the old lady all of them who were so kind to me will think i stole them  oh do have mercy upon me and send them back  with these words which were uttered with all the energy of passionate grief oliver fell upon his knees at the jews feet and beat his hands together in perfect desperation  the boys right remarked fagin looking covertly round and knitting his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot  youre right oliver youre right they will think you have stolen em  ha ha chuckled the jew rubbing his hands it couldnt have happened better if we had chosen our time  of course it couldnt replied sikes i knowd that directly i see him coming through clerkenwell with the books under his arm  its all right enough  theyre softhearted psalmsingers or they wouldnt have taken him in at all and theyll ask no questions after him fear they should be obliged to prosecute and so get him lagged  hes safe enough  oliver had looked from one to the other while these words were being spoken as if he were bewildered and could scarecely understand what passed but when bill sikes concluded he jumped suddenly to his feet and tore wildly from the room  uttering shrieks for help which made the bare old house echo to the roof  keep back the dog bill cried nancy springing before the door and closing it as the jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit  keep back the dog hell tear the boy to pieces  serve him right cried sikes struggling to disengage himself from the girls grasp  stand off from me or ill split your head against the wall  i dont care for that bill i dont care for that screamed the girl struggling violently with the man the child shant be torn down by the dog unless you kill me first  shant he said sikes setting his teeth  ill soon do that if you dont keep off  the housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room just as the jew and the two boys returned dragging oliver among them  whats the matter here said fagin looking round  the girls gone mad i think replied sikes savagely  no she hasnt said nancy pale and breathless from the scuffle no she hasnt fagin dont think it  then keep quiet will you said the jew with a threatening look  no i wont do that neither replied nancy speaking very loud come  what do you think of that  mr fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of that particular species of humanity to which nancy belonged to feel tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any conversation with her at present  with the view of diverting the attention of the company he turned to oliver  so you wanted to get away my dear did you said the jew taking up a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace eh  oliver made no reply  but he watched the jews motions and breathed quickly  wanted to get assistance called for the police did you sneered the jew catching the boy by the arm  well cure you of that my young master  the jew inflicted a smart blow on olivers shoulders with the club and was raising it for a second when the girl rushing forward wrested it from his hand  she flung it into the fire with a force that brought some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room  i wont stand by and see it done fagin cried the girl youve got the boy and what more would you havelet him belet him beor i shall put that mark on some of you that will bring me to the gallows before my time  the girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this threat and with her lips compressed and her hands clenched looked alternately at the jew and the other robber her face quite colourless from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself  why nancy said the jew in a soothing tone after a pause during which he and mr sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner youyoure more clever than ever tonight  ha ha my dear you are acting beautifully  am i said the girl  take care i dont overdo it  you will be the worse for it fagin if i do and so i tell you in good time to keep clear of me  there is something about a roused woman especially if she add to all her other strong passions the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair which few men like to provoke the jew saw that it would be hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of miss nancys rage and shrinking involuntarily back a few paces cast a glance half imploring and half cowardly at sikes as if to hint that he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue  mr sikes thus mutely appealed to and possibly feeling his personal pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of miss nancy to reason gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of his invention as they produced no visible effect on the object against whom they were discharged however he resorted to more tangible arguments  what do you mean by this said sikes backing the inquiry with a very common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features which if it were heard above only once out of every fifty thousand times that it is uttered below would render blindness as common a disorder as measles what do you mean by it  burn my body  do you know who you are and what you are  oh yes i know all about it replied the girl laughing hysterically and shaking her head from side to side with a poor assumption of indifference  well then keep quiet rejoined sikes with a growl like that he was accustomed to use when addressing his dog or ill quiet you for a good long time to come  the girl laughed again even less composedly than before and darting a hasty look at sikes turned her face aside and bit her lip till the blood came  youre a nice one added sikes as he surveyed her with a contemptuous air to take up the humane and genteel side  a pretty subject for the child as you call him to make a friend of  god almighty help me i am cried the girl passionately and i wish i had been struck dead in the street or had changed places with them we passed so near tonight before i had lent a hand in bringing him here  hes a thief a liar a devil all thats bad from this night forth  isnt that enough for the old wretch without blows  come come sikes said the jew appealing to him in a remonstratory tone and motioning towards the boys who were eagerly attentive to all that passed we must have civil words civil words bill  civil words cried the girl whose passion was frightful to see civil words you villain  yes you deserve em from me i thieved for you when i was a child not half as old as this pointing to oliver i have been in the same trade and in the same service for twelve years since  dont you know it  speak out  dont you know it  well well replied the jew with an attempt at pacification and if you have its your living  aye it is returned the girl not speaking but pouring out the words in one continuous and vehement scream  it is my living and the cold wet dirty streets are my home and youre the wretch that drove me to them long ago and thatll keep me there day and night day and night till i die  i shall do you a mischief interposed the jew goaded by these reproaches a mischief worse than that if you say much more  the girl said nothing more but tearing her hair and dress in a transport of passion made such a rush at the jew as would probably have left signal marks of her revenge upon him had not her wrists been seized by sikes at the right moment upon which she made a few ineffectual struggles and fainted  shes all right now said sikes laying her down in a corner shes uncommon strong in the arms when shes up in this way  the jew wiped his forehead and smiled as if it were a relief to have the disturbance over but neither he nor sikes nor the dog nor the boys seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance incidental to business  its the worst of having to do with women said the jew replacing his club but theyre clever and we cant get on in our line without em  charley show oliver to bed  i suppose hed better not wear his best clothes tomorrow fagin had he inquired charley bates  certainly not replied the jew reciprocating the grin with which charley put the question  master bates apparently much delighted with his commission took the cleft stick and led oliver into an adjacent kitchen where there were two or three of the beds on which he had slept before and here with many uncontrollable bursts of laughter he produced the identical old suit of clothes which oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at mr brownlows and the accidental display of which to fagin by the jew who purchased them had been the very first clue received of his whereabout  put off the smart ones said charley and ill give em to fagin to take care of  what fun it is  poor oliver unwillingly complied  master bates rolling up the new clothes under his arm departed from the room leaving oliver in the dark and locking the door behind him  the noise of charleys laughter and the voice of miss betsy who opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend and perform other feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery might have kept many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which oliver was placed  but he was sick and weary and he soon fell sound asleep
