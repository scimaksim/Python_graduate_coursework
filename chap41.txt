chapter xxxix  introduces some respectable characters with whom the reader is already acquainted and shows how monks and the jew laid their worthy heads together  on the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in the last chapter disposed of their little matter of business as therein narrated mr william sikes awakening from a nap drowsily growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was  the room in which mr sikes propounded this question was not one of those he had tenanted previous to the chertsey expedition although it was in the same quarter of the town and was situated at no great distance from his former lodgings  it was not in appearance so desirable a habitation as his old quarters  being a mean and badlyfurnished apartment of very limited size lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof and abutting on a close and dirty lane  nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentlemans having gone down in the world of late  for a great scarcity of furniture and total absence of comfort together with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen bespoke a state of extreme poverty while the meagre and attenuated condition of mr sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms if they had stood in any need of corroboration  the housebreaker was lying on the bed wrapped in his white greatcoat by way of dressinggown and displaying a set of features in no degree improved by the cadaverous hue of illness and the addition of a soiled nightcap and a stiff black beard of a weeks growth  the dog sat at the bedside  now eyeing his master with a wistful look and now pricking his ears and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street or in the lower part of the house attracted his attention seated by the window busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the robbers ordinary dress was a female  so pale and reduced with watching and privation that there would have been considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same nancy who has already figured in this tale but for the voice in which she replied to mr sikess question  not long gone seven said the girl  how do you feel tonight bill  as weak as water replied mr sikes with an imprecation on his eyes and limbs  here lend us a hand and let me get off this thundering bed anyhow  illness had not improved mr sikess temper for as the girl raised him up and led him to a chair he muttered various curses on her awkwardness and struck her  whining are you said sikes  come  dont stand snivelling there if you cant do anything better than that cut off altogether  dye hear me  i hear you replied the girl turning her face aside and forcing a laugh  what fancy have you got in your head now  oh youve thought better of it have you growled sikes marking the tear which trembled in her eye  all the better for you you have  why you dont mean to say youd be hard upon me tonight bill said the girl laying her hand upon his shoulder  no cried mr sikes  why not  such a number of nights said the girl with a touch of womans tenderness which communicated something like sweetness of tone even to her voice such a number of nights as ive been patient with you nursing and caring for you as if you had been a child and this the first that ive seen you like yourself you wouldnt have served me as you did just now if youd thought of that would you  come come say you wouldnt  well then rejoined mr sikes i wouldnt  why damme now the girlss whining again  its nothing said the girl throwing herself into a chair dont you seem to mind me  itll soon be over  whatll be over demanded mr sikes in a savage voice what foolery are you up to now again  get up and bustle about and dont come over me with your womans nonsense  at any other time this remonstrance and the tone in which it was delivered would have had the desired effect but the girl being really weak and exhausted dropped her head over the back of the chair and fainted before mr sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths with which on similar occasions he was accustomed to garnish his threats  not knowing very well what to do in this uncommon emergency for miss nancys hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the patient fights and struggles out of without much assistance mr sikes tried a little blasphemy and finding that mode of treatment wholly ineffectual called for assistance  whats the matter here my dear said fagin looking in  lend a hand to the girl cant you replied sikes impatiently dont stand chattering and grinning at me  with an exclamation of surprise fagin hastened to the girls assistance while mr john dawkins otherwise the artful dodger who had followed his venerable friend into the room hastily deposited on the floor a bundle with which he was laden and snatching a bottle from the grasp of master charles bates who came close at his heels uncorked it in a twinkling with his teeth and poured a portion of its contents down the patients throat  previously taking a taste himself to prevent mistakes  give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows charley said mr dawkins and you slap her hands fagin while bill undoes the petticuts  these united restoratives administered with great energy especially that department consigned to master bates who appeared to consider his share in the proceedings a piece of unexampled pleasantry  were not long in producing the desired effect  the girl gradually recovered her senses and staggering to a chair by the bedside hid her face upon the pillow  leaving mr sikes to confront the new comers in some astonishment at their unlookedfor appearance  why what evil wind has blowed you here he asked fagin  no evil wind at all my dear for evil winds blow nobody any good and ive brought something good with me that youll be glad to see dodger my dear open the bundle and give bill the little trifles that we spent all our money on this morning  in compliance with mr fagins request the artful untied this bundle which was of large size and formed of an old tablecloth and handed the articles it contained one by one to charley bates who placed them on the table with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence  sitch a rabbit pie bill exclaimed that young gentleman disclosing to view a huge pasty sitch delicate creeturs with sitch tender limbs bill that the wery bones melt in your mouth and theres no occasion to pick em half a pound of seven and sixpenny green so precious strong that if you mix it with biling water itll go nigh to blow the lid of the teapot off a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didnt work at all at afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodnessoh no  two halfquartern brans pound of best fresh piece of double gloster and to wind up all some of the richest sort you ever lushed  uttering this last panegyric master bates produced from one of his extensive pockets a fullsized winebottle carefully corked while mr dawkins at the same instant poured out a wineglassful of raw spirits from the bottle he carried  which the invalid tossed down his throat without a moments hesitation  ah said fagin rubbing his hands with great satisfaction youll do bill youll do now  do exclaimed mr sikes i might have been done for twenty times over afore youd have done anything to help me  what do you mean by leaving a man in this state three weeks and more you falsehearted wagabond  only hear him boys said fagin shrugging his shoulders and us come to bring him all these beautiful things  the things is well enough in their way observed mr sikes  a little soothed as he glanced over the table but what have you got to say for yourself why you should leave me here down in the mouth health blunt and everything else and take no more notice of me all this mortal time than if i was that ere dogdrive him down charley  i never see such a jolly dog as that cried master bates doing as he was desired  smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market hed make his fortun on the stage that dog would and rewive the drayma besides  hold your din cried sikes as the dog retreated under the bed still growling angrily  what have you got to say for yourself you withered old fence eh  i was away from london a week and more my dear on a plant replied the jew  and what about the other fortnight demanded sikes  what about the other fortnight that youve left me lying here like a sick rat in his hole  i couldnt help it bill  i cant go into a long explanation before company but i couldnt help it upon my honour  upon your what growled sikes with excessive disgust here cut me off a piece of that pie one of you boys to take the taste of that out of my mouth or itll choke me dead  dont be out of temper my dear urged fagin submissively i have never forgot you bill never once  no  ill pound it that you hant replied sikes with a bitter grin youve been scheming and plotting away every hour that i have laid shivering and burning here and bill was to do this and bill was to do that and bill was to do it all dirt cheap as soon as he got well and was quite poor enough for your work if it hadnt been for the girl i might have died  there now bill remonstrated fagin eagerly catching at the word if it hadnt been for the girl  who but poor ould fagin was the means of your having such a handy girl about you  he says true enough there said nancy coming hastily forward let him be let him be  nancys appearance gave a new turn to the conversation for the boys receiving a sly wink from the wary old jew began to ply her with liquor of which however she took very sparingly while fagin assuming an unusual flow of spirits gradually brought mr sikes into a better temper by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter and moreover by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes which after repeated applications to the spiritbottle he condescended to make  its all very well said mr sikes but i must have some blunt from you tonight  i havent a piece of coin about me replied the jew  then youve got lots at home retorted sikes and i must have some from there  lots cried fagin holding up is hands  i havent so much as would  i dont know how much youve got and i dare say you hardly know yourself as it would take a pretty long time to count it said sikes but i must have some tonight and thats flat  well well said fagin with a sigh ill send the artful round presently  you wont do nothing of the kind rejoined mr sikes the artfuls a deal too artful and would forget to come or lose his way or get dodged by traps and so be perwented or anything for an excuse if you put him up to it  nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it to make all sure and ill lie down and have a snooze while shes gone  after a great deal of haggling and squabbling fagin beat down the amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and sixpence protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only leave him eighteenpence to keep house with mr sikes sullenly remarking that if he couldnt get any more he must accompany him home with the dodger and master bates put the eatables in the cupboard  the jew then taking leave of his affectionate friend returned homeward attended by nancy and the boys  mr sikes meanwhile flinging himself on the bed and composing himself to sleep away the time until the young ladys return  in due course they arrived at fagins abode where they found toby crackit and mr chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost and with it his fifteenth and last sixpence much to the amusement of his young friends  mr crackit apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental endowments yawned and inquiring after sikes took up his hat to go  has nobody been toby asked fagin  not a living leg answered mr crackit pulling up his collar its been as dull as swipes  you ought to stand something handsome fagin to recompense me for keeping house so long damme im as flat as a juryman and should have gone to sleep as fast as newgate if i hadnt had the good natur to amuse this youngster  horrid dull im blessed if i ant  with these and other ejaculations of the same kind mr toby crackit swept up his winnings and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty air as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the consideration of a man of his figure this done he swaggered out of the room with so much elegance and gentility that mr chitling bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of sight assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview and that he didnt value his losses the snap of his little finger  wot a rum chap you are tom said master bates highly amused by this declaration  not a bit of it replied mr chitling  am i fagin  a very clever fellow my dear said fagin patting him on the shoulder and winking to his other pupils  and mr crackit is a heavy swell ant he fagin asked tom  no doubt at all of that my dear  and it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance ant it fagin pursued tom  very much so indeed my dear  theyre only jealous tom because he wont give it to them  ah cried tom triumphantly thats where it is  he has cleaned me out  but i can go and earn some more when i like cant i fagin  to be sure you can and the sooner you go the better tom so make up your loss at once and dont lose any more time  dodger charley its time you were on the lay  come  its near ten and nothing done yet  in obedience to this hint the boys nodding to nancy took up their hats and left the room the dodger and his vivacious friend indulging as they went in many witticisms at the expense of mr chitling in whose conduct it is but justice to say there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar  inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town who pay a much higher price than mr chitling for being seen in good society  and a great number of fine gentlemen composing the good society aforesaid who established their reputation upon very much the same footing as flash toby crackit  now said fagin when they had left the room ill go and get you that cash nancy  this is only the key of a little cupboard where i keep a few odd things the boys get my dear  i never lock up my money for ive got none to lock up my dearha ha hanone to lock up its a poor trade nancy and no thanks but im fond of seeing the young people about me and i bear it all i bear it all  hush he said hastily concealing the key in his breast whos that  listen  the girl who was sitting at the table with her arms folded appeared in no way interested in the arrival or to care whether the person whoever he was came or went  until the murmur of a mans voice reached her ears  the instant she caught the sound she tore off her bonnet and shawl with the rapidity of lightning and thrust them under the table the jew turning round immediately afterwards she muttered a complaint of the heat  in a tone of languor that contrasted very remarkably with the extreme haste and violence of this action  which however had been unobserved by fagin who had his back towards her at the time  bah he whispered as though nettled by the interruption its the man i expected before hes coming downstairs  not a word about the money while hes here nance  he wont stop long  not ten minutes my dear  laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip the jew carried a candle to the door as a mans step was heard upon the stairs without  he reached it at the same moment as the visitor who coming hastily into the room was close upon the girl before he observed her  it was monks  only one of my young people said fagin observing that monks drew back on beholding a stranger  dont move nancy  the girl drew closer to the table and glancing at monks with an air of careless levity withdrew her eyes but as he turned towards fagin she stole another look so keen and searching and full of purpose that if there had been any bystander to observe the change he could hardly have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person  any news inquired fagin  great  andandgood asked fagin hesitating as though he feared to vex the other man by being too sanguine  not bad any way replied monks with a smile  i have been prompt enough this time  let me have a word with you  the girl drew closer to the table and made no offer to leave the room although she could see that monks was pointing to her  the jew perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money if he endeavoured to get rid of her  pointed upward and took monks out of the room  not that infernal hole we were in before she could hear the man say as they went upstairs  fagin laughed and making some reply which did not reach her seemed by the creaking of the boards to lead his companion to the second story  before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house the girl had slipped off her shoes and drawing her gown loosely over her head and muffling her arms in it stood at the door listening with breathless interest  the moment the noise ceased she glided from the room ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence and was lost in the gloom above  the room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more the girl glided back with the same unearthly tread and immediately afterwards the two men were heard descending  monks went at once into the street and the jew crawled upstairs again for the money  when he returned the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet as if preparing to be gone  why nance exclaimed the jew starting back as he put down the candle how pale you are  pale echoed the girl shading her eyes with her hands as if to look steadily at him  quite horrible  what have you been doing to yourself  nothing that i know of except sitting in this close place for i dont know how long and all replied the girl carelessly come  let me get back thats a dear  with a sigh for every piece of money fagin told the amount into her hand  they parted without more conversation merely interchanging a goodnight  when the girl got into the open street she sat down upon a doorstep and seemed for a few moments wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way  suddenly she arose and hurrying on in a direction quite opposite to that in which sikes was awaiting her returned quickened her pace until it gradually resolved into a violent run  after completely exhausting herself she stopped to take breath  and as if suddenly recollecting herself and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon wrung her hands and burst into tears  it might be that her tears relieved her or that she felt the full hopelessness of her condition but she turned back and hurrying with nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction partly to recover lost time and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own thoughts  soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker  if she betrayed any agitation when she presented herself to mr sikes he did not observe it for merely inquiring if she had brought the money and receiving a reply in the affirmative he uttered a growl of satisfaction and replacing his head upon the pillow resumed the slumbers which her arrival had interrupted  it was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking and withal had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her behaviour and deportment  that she had all the abstracted and nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon would have been obvious to the lynxeyed fagin who would most probably have taken the alarm at once but mr sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody and being furthermore in an unusually amiable condition as has been already observed saw nothing unusual in her demeanor and indeed troubled himself so little about her that had her agitation been far more perceptible than it was it would have been very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions  as that day closed in the girls excitement increased and when night came on and she sat by watching until the housebreaker should drink himself asleep there was an unusual paleness in her cheek and a fire in her eye that even sikes observed with astonishment  mr sikes being weak from the fever was lying in bed taking hot water with his gin to render it less inflammatory and had pushed his glass towards nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time when these symptoms first struck him  why burn my body said the man raising himself on his hands as he stared the girl in the face  you look like a corpse come to life again  whats the matter  matter replied the girl  nothing  what do you look at me so hard for  what foolery is this demanded sikes grasping her by the arm and shaking her roughly  what is it  what do you mean  what are you thinking of  of many things bill replied the girl shivering and as she did so pressing her hands upon her eyes  but lord  what odds in that  the tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken seemed to produce a deeper impression on sikes than the wild and rigid look which had preceded them  i tell you wot it is said sikes if you havent caught the fever and got it comin on now theres something more than usual in the wind and something dangerous too  youre not agoing to  no damme you wouldnt do that  do what asked the girl  there aint said sikes fixing his eyes upon her and muttering the words to himself there aint a stauncherhearted gal going or id have cut her throat three months ago  shes got the fever coming on thats it  fortifying himself with this assurance sikes drained the glass to the bottom and then with many grumbling oaths called for his physic the girl jumped up with great alacrity poured it quickly out but with her back towards him and held the vessel to his lips while he drank off the contents  now said the robber come and sit aside of me and put on your own face or ill alter it so that you wont know it agin when you do want it  the girl obeyed  sikes locking her hand in his fell back upon the pillow turning his eyes upon her face  they closed opened again closed once more again opened  he shifted his position restlessly and after dozing again and again for two or three minutes and as often springing up with a look of terror and gazing vacantly about him was suddenly stricken as it were while in the very attitude of rising into a deep and heavy sleep  the grasp of his hand relaxed the upraised arm fell languidly by his side and he lay like one in a profound trance  the laudanum has taken effect at last murmured the girl as she rose from the bedside  i may be too late even now  she hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl  looking fearfully round from time to time as if despite the sleeping draught she expected every moment to feel the pressure of sikess heavy hand upon her shoulder then stooping softly over the bed she kissed the robbers lips and then opening and closing the roomdoor with noiseless touch hurried from the house  a watchman was crying halfpast nine down a dark passage through which she had to pass in gaining the main thoroughfare  has it long gone the halfhour asked the girl  itll strike the hour in another quarter said the man raising his lantern to her face  and i cannot get there in less than an hour or more muttered nancy brushing swiftly past him and gliding rapidly down the street  many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues through which she tracked her way in making from spitalfields towards the westend of london  the clock struck ten increasing her impatience  she tore along the narrow pavement  elbowing the passengers from side to side and darting almost under the horses heads crossed crowded streets where clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the like  the woman is mad said the people turning to look after her as she rushed away  when she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town the streets were comparatively deserted and here her headlong progress excited a still greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past  some quickened their pace behind as though to see whither she was hastening at such an unusual rate and a few made head upon her and looked back surprised at her undiminished speed but they fell off one by one and when she neared her place of destination she was alone  it was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near hyde park as the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door guided her to the spot the clock struck eleven  she had loitered for a few paces as though irresolute and making up her mind to advance but the sound determined her and she stepped into the hall  the porters seat was vacant  she looked round with an air of incertitude and advanced towards the stairs  now young woman said a smartlydressed female looking out from a door behind her who do you want here  a lady who is stopping in this house answered the girl  a lady was the reply accompanied with a scornful look what lady  miss maylie said nancy  the young woman who had by this time noted her appearance replied only by a look of virtuous disdain and summoned a man to answer her to him nancy repeated her request  what name am i to say asked the waiter  its of no use saying any replied nancy  nor business said the man  no nor that neither rejoined the girl  i must see the lady  come said the man pushing her towards the door  none of this take yourself off  i shall be carried out if i go said the girl violently and i can make that a job that two of you wont like to do  isnt there anybody here she said looking round that will see a simple message carried for a poor wretch like me  this appeal produced an effect on a goodtemperedfaced mancook who with some of the other servants was looking on and who stepped forward to interfere  take it up for her joe cant you said this person  whats the good replied the man  you dont suppose the young lady will see such as her do you  this allusion to nancys doubtful character raised a vast quantity of chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids who remarked with great fervour that the creature was a disgrace to her sex and strongly advocated her being thrown ruthlessly into the kennel  do what you like with me said the girl turning to the men again but do what i ask you first and i ask you to give this message for god almightys sake  the softhearted cook added his intercession and the result was that the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery  whats it to be said the man with one foot on the stairs  that a young woman earnestly asks to speak to miss maylie alone said nancy and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say she will know whether to hear her business or to have her turned out of doors as an impostor  i say said the man youre coming it strong  you give the message said the girl firmly and let me hear the answer  the man ran upstairs  nancy remained pale and almost breathless listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific and of which they became still more so when the man returned and said the young woman was to walk upstairs  its no good being proper in this world said the first housemaid  brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire said the second  the third contented herself with wondering what ladies was made of and the fourth took the first in a quartette of shameful with which the dianas concluded  regardless of all this for she had weightier matters at heart nancy followed the man with trembling limbs to a small antechamber lighted by a lamp from the ceiling here he left her and retired
