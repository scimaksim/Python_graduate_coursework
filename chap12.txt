chapter xi  treats of mr fang the police magistrate and furnishes a slight specimen of his mode of administering justice  the offence had been committed within the district and indeed in the immediate neighborhood of a very notorious metropolitan police office the crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying oliver through two or three streets and down a place called mutton hill when he was led beneath a low archway and up a dirty court into this dispensary of summary justice by the back way  it was a small paved yard into which they turned and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of whiskers on his face and a bunch of keys in his hand  whats the matter now said the man carelessly  a young foglehunter replied the man who had oliver in charge  are you the party thats been robbed sir inquired the man with the keys  yes i am replied the old gentleman but i am not sure that this boy actually took the handkerchief  ii would rather not press the case  must go before the magistrate now sir replied the man his worship will be disengaged in half a minute  now young gallows  this was an invitation for oliver to enter through a door which he unlocked as he spoke and which led into a stone cell  here he was searched and nothing being found upon him locked up  this cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar only not so light  it was most intolerably dirty for it was monday morning and it had been tenanted by six drunken people who had been locked up elsewhere since saturday night  but this is little  in our stationhouses men and women are every night confined on the most trivial chargesthe word is worth notingin dungeons compared with which those in newgate occupied by the most atrocious felons tried found guilty and under sentence of death are palaces let any one who doubts this compare the two  the old gentleman looked almost as rueful as oliver when the key grated in the lock  he turned with a sigh to the book which had been the innocent cause of all this disturbance  there is something in that boys face said the old gentleman to himself as he walked slowly away tapping his chin with the cover of the book in a thoughtful manner something that touches and interests me  can he be innocent  he looked likebye the bye exclaimed the old gentleman halting very abruptly and staring up into the sky bless my soulwhere have i seen something like that look before  after musing for some minutes the old gentleman walked with the same meditative face into a back anteroom opening from the yard and there retiring into a corner called up before his minds eye a vast amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years  no said the old gentleman shaking his head it must be imagination  he wandered over them again  he had called them into view and it was not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them  there were the faces of friends and foes and of many that had been almost strangers peering intrusively from the crowd there were the faces of young and blooming girls that were now old women there were faces that the grave had changed and closed upon but which the mind superior to its power still dressed in their old freshness and beauty calling back the lustre of the eyes the brightness of the smile the beaming of the soul through its mask of clay and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb changed but to be heightened and taken from earth only to be set up as a light to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to heaven  but the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which olivers features bore a trace  so he heaved a sigh over the recollections he awakened and being happily for himself an absent old gentleman buried them again in the pages of the musty book  he was roused by a touch on the shoulder and a request from the man with the keys to follow him into the office  he closed his book hastily and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned mr fang  the office was a front parlour with a panelled wall  mr fang sat behind a bar at the upper end and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen in which poor little oliver was already deposited trembling very much at the awfulness of the scene  mr fang was a lean longbacked stiffnecked middlesized man with no great quantity of hair and what he had growing on the back and sides of his head  his face was stern and much flushed  if he were really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him he might have brought action against his countenance for libel and have recovered heavy damages  the old gentleman bowed respectfully and advancing to the magistrates desk said suiting the action to the word that is my name and address sir  he then withdrew a pace or two and with another polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head waited to be questioned  now it so happened that mr fang was at that moment perusing a leading article in a newspaper of the morning adverting to some recent decision of his and commending him for the three hundred and fiftieth time to the special and particular notice of the secretary of state for the home department  he was out of temper and he looked up with an angry scowl  who are you said mr fang  the old gentleman pointed with some surprise to his card  officer said mr fang tossing the card contemptuously away with the newspaper  who is this fellow  my name sir said the old gentleman speaking like a gentleman my name sir is brownlow  permit me to inquire the name of the magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable person under the protection of the bench  saying this mr brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford him the required information  officer said mr fang throwing the paper on one side whats this fellow charged with  hes not charged at all your worship replied the officer he appears against this boy your worship  his worship knew this perfectly well but it was a good annoyance and a safe one  appears against the boy does he said mr fang surveying mr brownlow contemptuously from head to foot  swear him  before i am sworn i must beg to say one word said mr brownlow and that is that i really never without actual experience could have believed  hold your tongue sir said mr fang peremptorily  i will not sir replied the old gentleman  hold your tongue this instant or ill have you turned out of the office said mr fang  youre an insolent impertinent fellow  how dare you bully a magistrate  what exclaimed the old gentleman reddening  swear this person said fang to the clerk  ill not hear another word  swear him  mr brownlows indignation was greatly roused but reflecting perhaps that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it he suppressed his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once  now said fang whats the charge against this boy  what have you got to say sir  i was standing at a bookstall mr brownlow began  hold your tongue sir said mr fang  policeman  wheres the policeman  here swear this policeman  now policeman what is this  the policeman with becoming humility related how he had taken the charge how he had searched oliver and found nothing on his person and how that was all he knew about it  are there any witnesses inquired mr fang  none your worship replied the policeman  mr fang sat silent for some minutes and then turning round to the prosecutor said in a towering passion  do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is man or do you not  you have been sworn  now if you stand there refusing to give evidence ill punish you for disrespect to the bench i will by  by what or by whom nobody knows for the clerk and jailor coughed very loud just at the right moment and the former dropped a heavy book upon the floor thus preventing the word from being heardaccidently of course  with many interruptions and repeated insults mr brownlow contrived to state his case  observing that in the surprise of the moment he had run after the boy because he had saw him running away and expressing his hope that if the magistrate should believe him although not actually the thief to be connected with the thieves he would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow  he has been hurt already said the old gentleman in conclusion and i fear he added with great energy looking towards the bar i really fear that he is ill  oh yes i dare say said mr fang with a sneer  come none of your tricks here you young vagabond they wont do whats your name  oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him  he was deadly pale and the whole place seemed turning round and round  whats your name you hardened scoundrel demanded mr fang officer whats his name  this was addressed to a bluff old fellow in a striped waistcoat who was standing by the bar  he bent over oliver and repeated the inquiry but finding him really incapable of understanding the question and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more and add to the severity of his sentence he hazarded a guess  he says his names tom white your worship said the kindhearted thieftaker  oh he wont speak out wont he said fang  very well very well where does he live  where he can your worship replied the officer again pretending to receive olivers answer  has he any parents inquired mr fang  he says they died in his infancy your worship replied the officer hazarding the usual reply  at this point of the inquiry oliver raised his head and looking round with imploring eyes murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water  stuff and nonsense said mr fang  dont try to make a fool of me  i think he really is ill your worship remonstrated the officer  i know better said mr fang  take care of him officer said the old gentleman raising his hands instinctively hell fall down  stand away officer cried fang  let him if he likes  oliver availed himself of the kind permission and fell to the floor in a fainting fit  the men in the office looked at each other but no one dared to stir  i knew he was shamming said fang as if this were incontestable proof of the fact  let him lie there hell soon be tired of that  how do you propose to deal with the case sir  inquired the clerk in a low voice  summarily replied mr fang  he stands committed for three monthshard labour of course  clear the office  the door was opened for this purpose and a couple of men were preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell when an elderly man of decent but poor appearance clad in an old suit of black rushed hastily into the office and advanced towards the bench  stop stop  dont take him away  for heavens sake stop a moment cried the new comer breathless with haste  although the presiding genii in such an office as this exercise a summary and arbitrary power over the liberties the good name the character almost the lives of her majestys subjects expecially of the poorer class and although within such walls enough fantastic tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping they are closed to the public save through the medium of the daily pressfootnote  or were virtually then mr fang was consequently not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder  what is this  who is this  turn this man out  clear the office cried mr fang  i will speak cried the man i will not be turned out  i saw it all  i keep the bookstall  i demand to be sworn i will not be put down  mr fang you must hear me  you must not refuse sir  the man was right  his manner was determined and the matter was growing rather too serious to be hushed up  swear the man growled mr fang with a very ill grace now man what have you got to say  this said the man  i saw three boys  two others and the prisoner here  loitering on the opposite side of the way when this gentleman was reading  the robbery was committed by another boy  i saw it done and i saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it having by this time recovered a little breath the worthy bookstall keeper proceeded to relate in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of the robbery  why didnt you come here before said fang after a pause  i hadnt a soul to mind the shop replied the man  everybody who could have helped me had joined in the pursuit  i could get nobody till five minutes ago and ive run here all the way  the prosecutor was reading was he inquired fang after another pause  yes replied the man  the very book he has in his hand  oh that book eh said fang  is it paid for  no it is not replied the man with a smile  dear me i forgot all about it exclaimed the absent old gentleman innocently  a nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy said fang with a comical effort to look humane  i consider sir that you have obtained possession of that book under very suspicious and disreputable circumstances and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of the property declines to prosecute let this be a lesson to you my man or the law will overtake you yet  the boy is discharged  clear the office  dn me cried the old gentleman bursting out with the rage he had kept down so long dn me   ill  clear the office said the magistrate  officers do you hear clear the office  the mandate was obeyed and the indignant mr brownlow was conveyed out with the book in one hand and the bamboo cane in the other  in a perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance  he reached the yard and his passion vanished in a moment  little oliver twist lay on his back on the pavement with his shirt unbuttoned and his temples bathed with water his face a deadly white and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame  poor boy poor boy said mr brownlow bending over him call a coach somebody pray  directly  a coach was obtained and oliver having been carefully laid on the seat the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other  may i accompany you said the bookstall keeper looking in  bless me yes my dear sir said mr brownlow quickly  i forgot you  dear dear  i have this unhappy book still jump in  poor fellow  theres no time to lose  the bookstall keeper got into the coach and away they drove
