chapter xxiii  which contains the substance of a pleasant conversation between mr bumble and a lady and shows that even a beadle may be susceptible on some points  the night was bitter cold  the snow lay on the ground frozen into a hard thick crust so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad  which as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found caught it savagely up in clouds and whirling it into a thousand misty eddies scattered it in air  bleak dark and piercing cold it was a night for the wellhoused and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank god they were at home and for the homeless starving wretch to lay him down and die  many hungerworn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets at such times who let their crimes have been what they may can hardly open them in a more bitter world  such was the aspect of outofdoors affairs when mrs corney the matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the birthplace of oliver twist sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her own little room and glanced with no small degree of complacency at a small round table  on which stood a tray of corresponding size furnished with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons enjoy  in fact mrs corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea as she glanced from the table to the fireplace where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice her inward satisfaction evidently increasedso much so indeed that mrs corney smiled  well said the matron leaning her elbow on the table and looking reflectively at the fire im sure we have all on us a great deal to be grateful for  a great deal if we did but know it  ah  mrs corney shook her head mournfully as if deploring the mental blindness of those paupers who did not know it and thrusting a silver spoon private property into the inmost recesses of a twoounce tin teacaddy proceeded to make the tea  how slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds  the black teapot being very small and easily filled ran over while mrs corney was moralising and the water slightly scalded mrs corneys hand  drat the pot said the worthy matron setting it down very hastily on the hob a little stupid thing that only holds a couple of cups what use is it of to anybody  except said mrs corney pausing except to a poor desolate creature like me  oh dear  with these words the matron dropped into her chair and once more resting her elbow on the table thought of her solitary fate  the small teapot and the single cup had awakened in her mind sad recollections of mr corney who had not been dead more than fiveandtwenty years and she was overpowered  i shall never get another said mrs corney pettishly i shall never get anotherlike him  whether this remark bore reference to the husband or the teapot is uncertain  it might have been the latter for mrs corney looked at it as she spoke and took it up afterwards  she had just tasted her first cup when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the roomdoor  oh come in with you said mrs corney sharply  some of the old women dying i suppose  they always die when im at meals dont stand there letting the cold air in dont  whats amiss now eh  nothing maam nothing replied a mans voice  dear me exclaimed the matron in a much sweeter tone is that mr bumble  at your service maam said mr bumble who had been stopping outside to rub his shoes clean and to shake the snow off his coat and who now made his appearance bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in the other  shall i shut the door maam  the lady modestly hesitated to reply lest there should be any impropriety in holding an interview with mr bumble with closed doors mr bumble taking advantage of the hesitation and being very cold himself shut it without permission  hard weather mr bumble said the matron  hard indeed maam replied the beadle  antiporochial weather this maam  we have given away mrs corney we have given away a matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half this very blessed afternoon and yet them paupers are not contented  of course not  when would they be mr bumble said the matron sipping her tea  when indeed maam rejoined mr bumble  why heres one man that in consideration of his wife and large family has a quartern loaf and a good pound of cheese full weight  is he grateful maam  is he grateful  not a copper farthings worth of it  what does he do maam but ask for a few coals if its only a pocket handkerchief full he says  coals what would he do with coals  toast his cheese with em and then come back for more  thats the way with these people maam give em a apron full of coals today and theyll come back for another the day after tomorrow as brazen as alabaster  the matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile and the beadle went on  i never said mr bumble see anything like the pitch its got to the day afore yesterday a manyou have been a married woman maam and i may mention it to youa man with hardly a rag upon his back here mrs corney looked at the floor goes to our overseers door when he has got company coming to dinner and says he must be relieved mrs corney  as he wouldnt go away and shocked the company very much our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal  my heart says the ungrateful villain whats the use of this to me  you might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles  very good says our overseer taking em away again you wont get anything else here  then ill die in the streets says the vagrant  oh no you wont says our overseer  ha ha  that was very good  so like mr grannett wasnt it interposed the matron  well mr bumble  well maam rejoined the beadle he went away and he did die in the streets  theres a obstinate pauper for you  it beats anything i could have believed observed the matron emphatically  but dont you think outofdoor relief a very bad thing any way mr bumble  youre a gentleman of experience and ought to know  come  mrs corney said the beadle smiling as men smile who are conscious of superior information outofdoor relief properly managed properly managed maam is the porochial safeguard  the great principle of outofdoor relief is to give the paupers exactly what they dont want and then they get tired of coming  dear me exclaimed mrs corney  well that is a good one too  yes  betwixt you and me maam returned mr bumble thats the great principle and thats the reason why if you look at any cases that get into them owdacious newspapers youll always observe that sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese  thats the rule now mrs corney all over the country but however said the beadle stopping to unpack his bundle these are official secrets maam not to be spoken of except as i may say among the porochial officers such as ourselves this is the port wine maam that the board ordered for the infirmary real fresh genuine port wine only out of the cask this forenoon clear as a bell and no sediment  having held the first bottle up to the light and shaken it well to test its excellence mr bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped put it carefully in his pocket and took up his hat as if to go  youll have a very cold walk mr bumble said the matron  it blows maam replied mr bumble turning up his coatcollar enough to cut ones ears off  the matron looked from the little kettle to the beadle who was moving towards the door and as the beadle coughed preparatory to bidding her goodnight bashfully inquired whetherwhether he wouldnt take a cup of tea  mr bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again laid his hat and stick upon a chair and drew another chair up to the table  as he slowly seated himself he looked at the lady  she fixed her eyes upon the little teapot  mr bumble coughed again and slightly smiled  mrs corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet as she sat down her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle she coloured and applied herself to the task of making his tea  again mr bumble coughedlouder this time than he had coughed yet  sweet  mr bumble inquired the matron taking up the sugarbasin  very sweet indeed maam replied mr bumble  he fixed his eyes on mrs corney as he said this and if ever a beadle looked tender mr bumble was that beadle at that moment  the tea was made and handed in silence  mr bumble having spread a handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the splendour of his shorts began to eat and drink varying these amusements occasionally by fetching a deep sigh which however had no injurious effect upon his appetite but on the contrary rather seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department  you have a cat maam i see said mr bumble glancing at one who in the centre of her family was basking before the fire and kittens too i declare  i am so fond of them mr bumble you cant think replied the matron  theyre so happy so frolicsome and so cheerful that they are quite companions for me  very nice animals maam replied mr bumble approvingly so very domestic  oh yes rejoined the matron with enthusiasm so fond of their home too that its quite a pleasure im sure  mrs corney maam said mr bumble slowly and marking the time with his teaspoon i mean to say this maam that any cat or kitten that could live with you maam and not be fond of its home must be a ass maam  oh mr bumble remonstrated mrs corney  its of no use disguising facts maam said mr bumble slowly flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him doubly impressive i would drown it myself with pleasure  then youre a cruel man said the matron vivaciously as she held out her hand for the beadles cup and a very hardhearted man besides  hardhearted maam said mr bumble  hard  mr bumble resigned his cup without another word squeezed mrs corneys little finger as she took it and inflicting two openhanded slaps upon his laced waistcoat gave a mighty sigh and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the fire  it was a round table and as mrs corney and mr bumble had been sitting opposite each other with no great space between them and fronting the fire it will be seen that mr bumble in receding from the fire and still keeping at the table increased the distance between himself and mrs corney which proceeding some prudent readers will doubtless be disposed to admire and to consider an act of great heroism on mr bumbles part  he being in some sort tempted by time place and opportunity to give utterance to certain soft nothings which however well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land members of parliament ministers of state lord mayors and other great public functionaries but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity of a beadle  who as is well known should be the sternest and most inflexible among them all  whatever were mr bumbles intentions however and no doubt they were of the best it unfortunately happened as has been twice before remarked that the table was a round one consequently mr bumble moving his chair by little and little soon began to diminish the distance between himself and the matron and continuing to travel round the outer edge of the circle brought his chair in time close to that in which the matron was seated  indeed the two chairs touched and when they did so mr bumble stopped  now if the matron had moved her chair to the right she would have been scorched by the fire and if to the left she must have fallen into mr bumbles arms so being a discreet matron and no doubt foreseeing these consequences at a glance she remained where she was and handed mr bumble another cup of tea  hardhearted mrs corney said mr bumble stirring his tea and looking up into the matrons face are you hardhearted mrs corney  dear me exclaimed the matron what a very curious question from a single man  what can you want to know for mr bumble  the beadle drank his tea to the last drop finished a piece of toast whisked the crumbs off his knees wiped his lips and deliberately kissed the matron  mr bumble cried that discreet lady in a whisper for the fright was so great that she had quite lost her voice mr bumble i shall scream  mr bumble made no reply but in a slow and dignified manner put his arm round the matrons waist  as the lady had stated her intention of screaming of course she would have screamed at this additional boldness but that the exertion was rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door  which was no sooner heard than mr bumble darted with much agility to the wine bottles and began dusting them with great violence  while the matron sharply demanded who was there  it is worthy of remark as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear that her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity  if you please mistress said a withered old female pauper hideously ugly  putting her head in at the door old sally is agoing fast  well whats that to me angrily demanded the matron  i cant keep her alive can i  no no mistress replied the old woman nobody can shes far beyond the reach of help  ive seen a many people die little babes and great strong men and i know when deaths acoming well enough but shes troubled in her mind and when the fits are not on herand thats not often for she is dying very hardshe says she has got something to tell which you must hear  shell never die quiet till you come mistress  at this intelligence the worthy mrs corney muttered a variety of invectives against old women who couldnt even die without purposely annoying their betters and muffling herself in a thick shawl which she hastily caught up briefly requested mr bumble to stay till she came back lest anything particular should occur  bidding the messenger walk fast and not be all night hobbling up the stairs she followed her from the room with a very ill grace scolding all the way  mr bumbles conduct on being left to himself was rather inexplicable he opened the closet counted the teaspoons weighed the sugartongs closely inspected a silver milkpot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal and having satisfied his curiosity on these points put on his cocked hat cornerwise and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the table  having gone through this very extraordinary performance he took off the cocked hat again and spreading himself before the fire with his back towards it seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of the furniture
