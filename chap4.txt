chapter iv  oliver being offered another place makes his first entry into public life  in great families when an advantageous place cannot be obtained either in possession reversion remainder or expectancy for the young man who is growing up it is a very general custom to send him to sea  the board in imitation of so wise and salutary an example took counsel together on the expediency of shipping off oliver twist in some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port  this suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done with him the probability being that the skipper would flog him to death in a playful mood some day after dinner or would knock his brains out with an iron bar both pastimes being as is pretty generally known very favourite and common recreations among gentleman of that class  the more the case presented itself to the board in this point of view the more manifold the advantages of the step appeared so they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing for oliver effectually was to send him to sea without delay  mr bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabinboy without any friends and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the result of his mission when he encountered at the gate no less a person than mr sowerberry the parochial undertaker  mr sowerberry was a tall gaunt largejointed man attired in a suit of threadbare black with darned cotton stockings of the same colour and shoes to answer  his features were not naturally intended to wear a smiling aspect but he was in general rather given to professional jocosity  his step was elastic and his face betokened inward pleasantry as he advanced to mr bumble and shook him cordially by the hand  i have taken the measure of the two women that died last night mr bumble said the undertaker  youll make your fortune mr sowerberry said the beadle as he thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuffbox of the undertaker which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin  i say youll make your fortune mr sowerberry repeated mr bumble tapping the undertaker on the shoulder in a friendly manner with his cane  think so said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half disputed the probability of the event  the prices allowed by the board are very small mr bumble  so are the coffins replied the beadle with precisely as near an approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in  mr sowerberry was much tickled at this as of course he ought to be and laughed a long time without cessation  well well mr bumble he said at length theres no denying that since the new system of feeding has come in the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they used to be but we must have some profit mr bumble wellseasoned timber is an expensive article sir and all the iron handles come by canal from birmingham  well well said mr bumble every trade has its drawbacks a fair profit is of course allowable  of course of course replied the undertaker and if i dont get a profit upon this or that particular article why i make it up in the longrun you seehe he he  just so said mr bumble  though i must say continued the undertaker resuming the current of observations which the beadle had interrupted though i must say mr bumble that i have to contend against one very great disadvantage which is that all the stout people go off the quickest  the people who have been better off and have paid rates for many years are the first to sink when they come into the house and let me tell you mr bumble that three or four inches over ones calculation makes a great hole in ones profits especially when one has a family to provide for sir  as mr sowerberry said this with the becoming indignation of an illused man and as mr bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection on the honour of the parish the latter gentleman thought it advisable to change the subject  oliver twist being uppermost in his mind he made him his theme  by the bye said mr bumble you dont know anybody who wants a boy do you  a porochial prentis who is at present a deadweight a millstone as i may say round the porochial throat  liberal terms mr sowerberry liberal terms  as mr bumble spoke he raised his cane to the bill above him and gave three distinct raps upon the words five pounds  which were printed thereon in roman capitals of gigantic size  gadso said the undertaker taking mr bumble by the giltedged lappel of his official coat thats just the very thing i wanted to speak to you about  you knowdear me what a very elegant button this is mr bumble  i never noticed it before  yes i think it rather pretty said the beadle glancing proudly downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat the die is the same as the porochial sealthe good samaritan healing the sick and bruised man the board presented it to me on newyears morning mr sowerberry  i put it on i remember for the first time to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman who died in a doorway at midnight  i recollect said the undertaker the jury brought it in died from exposure to the cold and want of the common necessaries of life didnt they  mr bumble nodded  and they made it a special verdict i think said the undertaker by adding some words to the effect that if the relieving officer had  tush  foolery interposed the beadle  if the board attended to all the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk theyd have enough to do  very true said the undertaker they would indeed  juries said mr bumble grasping his cane tightly as was his wont when working into a passion juries is ineddicated vulgar grovelling wretches  so they are said the undertaker  they havent no more philosophy nor political economy about em than that said the beadle snapping his fingers contemptuously  no more they have acquiesced the undertaker  i despise em said the beadle growing very red in the face  so do i rejoined the undertaker  and i only wish wed a jury of the independent sort in the house for a week or two said the beadle the rules and regulations of the board would soon bring their spirit down for em  let em alone for that replied the undertaker  so saying he smiled approvingly to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer  mr bumble lifted off his cocked hat took a handkerchief from the inside of the crown wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had engendered fixed the cocked hat on again and turning to the undertaker said in a calmer voice  well what about the boy  oh replied the undertaker why you know mr bumble i pay a good deal towards the poors rates  hem said mr bumble  well  well replied the undertaker i was thinking that if i pay so much towards em ive a right to get as much out of em as i can mr bumble and soi think ill take the boy myself  mr bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm and led him into the building  mr sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes and it was arranged that oliver should go to him that evening upon likinga phrase which means in the case of a parish apprentice that if the master find upon a short trial that he can get enough work out of a boy without putting too much food into him he shall have him for a term of years to do what he likes with  when little oliver was taken before the gentlemen that evening and informed that he was to go that night as general houselad to a coffinmakers and that if he complained of his situation or ever came back to the parish again he would be sent to sea there to be drowned or knocked on the head as the case might be he evinced so little emotion that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal and ordered mr bumble to remove him forthwith  now although it was very natural that the board of all people in the world should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody they were rather out in this particular instance  the simple fact was that oliver instead of possessing too little feeling possessed rather too much and was in a fair way of being reduced for life to a state of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received he heard the news of his destination in perfect silence and having had his luggage put into his handwhich was not very difficult to carry inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel about half a foot square by three inches deephe pulled his cap over his eyes and once more attaching himself to mr bumbles coat cuff was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering  for some time mr bumble drew oliver along without notice or remark for the beadle carried his head very erect as a beadle always should and it being a windy day little oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts of mr bumbles coat as they blew open and disclosed to great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush kneebreeches  as they drew near to their destination however mr bumble thought it expedient to look down and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by his new master which he accordingly did with a fit and becoming air of gracious patronage  oliver  said mr bumble  yes sir replied oliver in a low tremulous voice  pull that cap off your eyes and hold up your head sir  although oliver did as he was desired at once and passed the back of his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes he left a tear in them when he looked up at his conductor  as mr bumble gazed sternly upon him it rolled down his cheek it was followed by another and another the child made a strong effort but it was an unsuccessful one withdrawing his other hand from mr bumbles he covered his face with both and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and bony fingers  well exclaimed mr bumble stopping short and darting at his little charge a look of intense malignity  well  of all the ungratefullest and worstdisposed boys as ever i see oliver you are the  no no sir sobbed oliver clinging to the hand which held the wellknown cane no no sir i will be good indeed indeed indeed i will sir  i am a very little boy sir and it is soso  so what inquired mr bumble in amazement  so lonely sir  so very lonely cried the child  everybody hates me  oh sir dont dont pray be cross to me  the child beat his hand upon his heart and looked in his companions face with tears of real agony  mr bumble regarded olivers piteous and helpless look with some astonishment for a few seconds hemmed three or four times in a husky manner and after muttering something about that troublesome cough bade oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy then once more taking his hand he walked on with him in silence  the undertaker who had just put up the shutters of his shop was making some entries in his daybook by the light of a most appropriate dismal candle when mr bumble entered  aha said the undertaker looking up from the book and pausing in the middle of a word is that you bumble  no one else mr sowerberry replied the beadle  here ive brought the boy  oliver made a bow  oh thats the boy is it said the undertaker  raising the candle above his head to get a better view of oliver mrs sowerberry will you have the goodness to come here a moment my dear  mrs sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop and presented the form of a short then squeezedup woman with a vixenish countenance  my dear said mr sowerberry deferentially this is the boy from the workhouse that i told you of  oliver bowed again  dear me said the undertakers wife hes very small  why he is rather small replied mr bumble looking at oliver as if it were his fault that he was no bigger he is small theres no denying it  but hell grow mrs sowerberryhell grow  ah  i dare say he will replied the lady pettishly on our victuals and our drink  i see no saving in parish children not i for they always cost more to keep than theyre worth however men always think they know best there  get downstairs little bag o bones  with this the undertakers wife opened a side door and pushed oliver down a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell damp and dark forming the anteroom to the coalcellar and denominated kitchen wherein sat a slatternly girl in shoes down at heel and blue worsted stockings very much out of repair  here charlotte said mr sowerberry who had followed oliver down give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for trip  he hasnt come home since the morning so he may go without em  i dare say the boy isnt too dainty to eat emare you boy  oliver whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat and who was trembling with eagerness to devour it replied in the negative and a plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him  i wish some wellfed philosopher whose meat and drink turn to gall within him whose blood is ice whose heart is iron could have seen oliver twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected i wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which oliver tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine  there is only one thing i should like better and that would be to see the philosopher making the same sort of meal himself with the same relish  well said the undertakers wife when oliver had finished his supper which she had regarded in silent horror and with fearful auguries of his future appetite have you done  there being nothing eatable within his reach oliver replied in the affirmative  then come with me said mrs sowerberry taking up a dim and dirty lamp and leading the way upstairs your beds under the counter  you dont mind sleeping among the coffins i suppose but it doesnt much matter whether you do or dont for you cant sleep anywhere else come dont keep me here all night  oliver lingered no longer but meekly followed his new mistress
