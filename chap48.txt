chapter xlvi  the appointment kept  the church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven as two figures emerged on london bridge  one which advanced with a swift and rapid step was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of some expected object the other figure was that of a man who slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find and at some distance accommodated his pace to hers  stopping when she stopped  and as she moved again creeping stealthily on  but never allowing himself in the ardour of his pursuit to gain upon her footsteps  thus they crossed the bridge from the middlesex to the surrey shore when the woman apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the footpassengers turned back  the movement was sudden but he who watched her was not thrown off his guard by it for shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure he suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement when she was about the same distance in advance as she had been before he slipped quietly down and followed her again at nearly the centre of the bridge she stopped  the man stopped too  it was a very dark night  the day had been unfavourable and at that hour and place there were few people stirring such as there were hurried quickly past  very possibly without seeing but certainly without noticing either the woman or the man who kept her in view their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such of londons destitute population as chanced to take their way over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to lay their heads they stood there in silence  neither speaking nor spoken to by any one who passed  a mist hung over the river deepening the red glare of the fires that burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs and rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks the old smokestained storehouses on either side rose heavy and dull from the dense mass of roofs and gables and frowned sternly upon water too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes the tower of old saint saviours church and the spire of saint magnus so long the giantwarders of the ancient bridge were visible in the gloom but the forest of shipping below bridge and the thickly scattered spires of churches above were nearly all hidden from sight  the girl had taken a few restless turns to and froclosely watched meanwhile by her hidden observerwhen the heavy bell of st pauls tolled for the death of another day  midnight had come upon the crowded city  the palace the nightcellar the jail the madhouse the chambers of birth and death of health and sickness the rigid face of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child  midnight was upon them all  the hour had not struck two minutes when a young lady accompanied by a greyhaired gentleman alighted from a hackneycarriage within a short distance of the bridge and having dismissed the vehicle walked straight towards it  they had scarcely set foot upon its pavement when the girl started and immediately made towards them  they walked onward looking about them with the air of persons who entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being realised when they were suddenly joined by this new associate they halted with an exclamation of surprise but suppressed it immediately for a man in the garments of a countryman came close upbrushed against them indeedat that precise moment  not here said nancy hurriedly i am afraid to speak to you here come awayout of the public roaddown the steps yonder  as she uttered these words and indicated with her hand the direction in which she wished them to proceed the countryman looked round and roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for passed on  the steps to which the girl had pointed were those which on the surrey bank and on the same side of the bridge as saint saviours church form a landingstairs from the river  to this spot the man bearing the appearance of a countryman hastened unobserved and after a moments survey of the place he began to descend  these stairs are a part of the bridge they consist of three flights just below the end of the second going down the stone wall on the left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the thames at this point the lower steps widen  so that a person turning that angle of the wall is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be above him if only a step the countryman looked hastily round when he reached this point and as there seemed no better place of concealment and the tide being out there was plenty of room he slipped aside with his back to the pilaster and there waited  pretty certain that they would come no lower and that even if he could not hear what was said he could follow them again with safety  so tardily stole the time in this lonely place and so eager was the spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had been led to expect that he more than once gave the matter up for lost and persuaded himself either that they had stopped far above or had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious conversation  he was on the point of emerging from his hidingplace and regaining the road above when he heard the sound of footsteps and directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear  he drew himself straight upright against the wall and scarcely breathing listened attentively  this is far enough said a voice which was evidently that of the gentleman  i will not suffer the young lady to go any farther  many people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far but you see i am willing to humour you  to humour me cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed youre considerate indeed sir  to humour me  well well its no matter  why for what said the gentleman in a kinder tone for what purpose can you have brought us to this strange place  why not have let me speak to you above there where it is light and there is something stirring instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole  i told you before replied nancy that i was afraid to speak to you there  i dont know why it is said the girl shuddering but i have such a fear and dread upon me tonight that i can hardly stand  a fear of what asked the gentleman who seemed to pity her  i scarcely know of what replied the girl  i wish i did horrible thoughts of death and shrouds with blood upon them and a fear that has made me burn as if i was on fire have been upon me all day  i was reading a book tonight to wile the time away and the same things came into the print  imagination said the gentleman soothing her  no imagination replied the girl in a hoarse voice ill swear i saw coffin written in every page of the book in large black lettersaye and they carried one close to me in the streets tonight  there is nothing unusual in that said the gentleman they have passed me often  real ones rejoined the girl  this was not  there was something so uncommon in her manner that the flesh of the concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words and the blood chilled within him  he had never experienced a greater relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies  speak to her kindly said the young lady to her companion poor creature  she seems to need it  your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as i am tonight and preached of flames and vengeance cried the girl  oh dear lady why arnt those who claim to be gods own folks as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you who having youth and beauty and all that they have lost might be a little proud instead of so much humbler  ah said the gentleman  a turk turns his face after washing it well to the east when he says his prayers these good people after giving their faces such a rub against the world as to take the smiles off turn with no less regularity to the darkest side of heaven between the mussulman and the pharisee commend me to the first  these words appeared to be addressed to the young lady and were perhaps uttered with the view of affording nancy time to recover herself  the gentleman shortly afterwards addressed himself to her  you were not here last sunday night he said  i couldnt come replied nancy i was kept by force  by whom  him that i told the young lady of before  you were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the subject which has brought us here tonight i hope asked the old gentleman  no replied the girl shaking her head  its not very easy for me to leave him unless he knows why i couldnt give him a drink of laudanum before i came away  did he awake before you returned inquired the gentleman  no and neither he nor any of them suspect me  good said the gentleman  now listen to me  i am ready replied the girl as he paused for a moment  this young lady the gentleman began has communicated to me and to some other friends who can be safely trusted what you told her nearly a fortnight since  i confess to you that i had doubts at first whether you were to be implicitly relied upon but now i firmly believe you are  i am said the girl earnestly  i repeat that i firmly believe it  to prove to you that i am disposed to trust you i tell you without reserve that we propose to extort the secret whatever it may be from the fear of this man monks  but ifif said the gentleman he cannot be secured or if secured cannot be acted upon as we wish you must deliver up the jew  fagin cried the girl recoiling  that man must be delivered up by you said the gentleman  i will not do it  i will never do it replied the girl devil that he is and worse than devil as he has been to me i will never do that  you will not said the gentleman who seemed fully prepared for this answer  never returned the girl  tell me why  for one reason rejoined the girl firmly for one reason that the lady knows and will stand by me in i know she will for i have her promise  and for this other reason besides that bad life as he has led i have led a bad life too there are many of us who have kept the same courses together and ill not turn upon them who mightany of themhave turned upon me but didnt bad as they are  then said the gentleman quickly as if this had been the point he had been aiming to attain put monks into my hands and leave him to me to deal with  what if he turns against the others  i promise you that in that case if the truth is forced from him there the matter will rest there must be circumstances in olivers little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye and if the truth is once elicited they shall go scot free  and if it is not suggested the girl  then pursued the gentleman this fagin shall not be brought to justice without your consent  in such a case i could show you reasons i think which would induce you to yield it  have i the ladys promise for that asked the girl  you have replied rose  my true and faithful pledge  monks would never learn how you knew what you do said the girl after a short pause  never replied the gentleman  the intelligence should be brought to bear upon him that he could never even guess  i have been a liar and among liars from a little child said the girl after another interval of silence but i will take your words  after receiving an assurance from both that she might safely do so she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener to discover even the purport of what she said to describe by name and situation the publichouse whence she had been followed that night  from the manner in which she occasionally paused it appeared as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she communicated  when she had thoroughly explained the localities of the place the best position from which to watch it without exciting observation and the night and hour on which monks was most in the habit of frequenting it she seemed to consider for a few moments for the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her recollection  he is tall said the girl and a strongly made man but not stout he has a lurking walk and as he walks constantly looks over his shoulder first on one side and then on the other dont forget that for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other mans that you might almost tell him by that alone  his face is dark like his hair and eyes and although he cant be more than six or eight and twenty withered and haggard his lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of teeth for he has desperate fits and sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with woundswhy did you start said the girl stopping suddenly  the gentleman replied in a hurried manner that he was not conscious of having done so and begged her to proceed  part of this said the girl i have drawn out from other people at the house i tell you of for i have only seen him twice and both times he was covered up in a large cloak  i think thats all i can give you to know him by  stay though she added  upon his throat  so high that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face  there is  a broad red mark like a burn or scald cried the gentleman  hows this said the girl  you know him  the young lady uttered a cry of surprise and for a few moments they were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe  i think i do said the gentleman breaking silence  i should by your description  we shall see  many people are singularly like each other  it may not be the same  as he expressed himself to this effect with assumed carelessness he took a step or two nearer the concealed spy as the latter could tell from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter it must be he  now he said returning  so it seemed by the sound  to the spot where he had stood before you have given us most valuable assistance young woman and i wish you to be the better for it what can i do to serve you  nothing replied nancy  you will not persist in saying that rejoined the gentleman with a voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and more obdurate heart think now  tell me  nothing sir rejoined the girl weeping  you can do nothing to help me  i am past all hope indeed  you put yourself beyond its pale said the gentleman the past has been a dreary waste with you of youthful energies misspent and such priceless treasures lavished as the creator bestows but once and never grants again but for the future you may hope i do not say that it is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind for that must come as you seek it but a quiet asylum either in england or if you fear to remain here in some foreign country it is not only within the compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you before the dawn of morning before this river wakes to the first glimpse of daylight you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment  come  i would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion or take one look at any old haunt or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you  quit them all while there is time and opportunity  she will be persuaded now cried the young lady  she hesitates i am sure  i fear not my dear said the gentleman  no sir i do not replied the girl after a short struggle  i am chained to my old life  i loathe and hate it now but i cannot leave it  i must have gone too far to turn backand yet i dont know for if you had spoken to me so some time ago i should have laughed it off  but she said looking hastily round this fear comes over me again  i must go home  home repeated the young lady with great stress upon the word  home lady rejoined the girl  to such a home as i have raised for myself with the work of my whole life  let us part i shall be watched or seen  go  go  if i have done you any service all i ask is that you leave me and let me go my way alone  it is useless said the gentleman with a sigh  we compromise her safety perhaps by staying here  we may have detained her longer than she expected already  yes yes urged the girl you have  what cried the young lady can be the end of this poor creatures life  what repeated the girl  look before you lady  look at that dark water  how many times do you read of such as i who spring into the tide and leave no living thing to care for or bewail them  it may be years hence or it may be only months but i shall come to that at last  do not speak thus pray returned the young lady sobbing  it will never reach your ears dear lady and god forbid such horrors should replied the girl  goodnight goodnight  the gentleman turned away  this purse cried the young lady  take it for my sake that you may have some resource in an hour of need and trouble  no replied the girl  i have not done this for money  let me have that to think of  and yetgive me something that you have worn  i should like to have somethingno no not a ringyour gloves or handkerchiefanything that i can keep as having belonged to you sweet lady  there  bless you  god bless you goodnight goodnight  the violent agitation of the girl and the apprehension of some discovery which would subject her to illusage and violence seemed to determine the gentleman to leave her as she requested  the sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased  the two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards appeared upon the bridge  they stopped at the summit of the stairs  hark cried the young lady listening  did she call  i thought i heard her voice  no my love replied mr brownlow looking sadly back she has not moved and will not till we are gone  rose maylie lingered but the old gentleman drew her arm through his and led her with gentle force away  as they disappeared the girl sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs and vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears  after a time she arose and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the street  the astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some minutes afterwards and having ascertained with many cautious glances round him that he was again alone crept slowly from his hidingplace and returned stealthily and in the shade of the wall in the same manner as he had descended  peeping out more than once when he reached the top to make sure that he was unobserved noah claypole darted away at his utmost speed and made for the jews house as fast as his legs would carry him
