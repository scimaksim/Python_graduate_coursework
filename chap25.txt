chapter xxiv  treats on a very poor subject  but is a short one and may be found of importance in this history  it was no unfit messenger of death who had disturbed the quiet of the matrons room  her body was bent by age her limbs trembled with palsy her face distorted into a mumbling leer resembled more the grotesque shaping of some wild pencil than the work of natures hand  alas  how few of natures faces are left alone to gladden us with their beauty  the cares and sorrows and hungerings of the world change them as they change hearts and it is only when those passions sleep and have lost their hold for ever that the troubled clouds pass off and leave heavens surface clear  it is a common thing for the countenances of the dead even in that fixed and rigid state to subside into the longforgotten expression of sleeping infancy and settle into the very look of early life so calm so peaceful do they grow again that those who knew them in their happy childhood kneel by the coffins side in awe and see the angel even upon earth  the old crone tottered along the passages and up the stairs muttering some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion being at length compelled to pause for breath she gave the light into her hand and remained behind to follow as she might while the more nimble superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay  it was a bare garretroom with a dim light burning at the farther end there was another old woman watching by the bed the parish apothecarys apprentice was standing by the fire making a toothpick out of a quill  cold night mrs corney said this young gentleman as the matron entered  very cold indeed sir replied the mistress in her most civil tones and dropping a curtsey as she spoke  you should get better coals out of your contractors said the apothecarys deputy breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty poker these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night  theyre the boards choosing sir returned the matron the least they could do would be to keep us pretty warm  for our places are hard enough  the conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman  oh said the young mag turning his face towards the bed as if he had previously quite forgotten the patient its all up there mrs corney  it is is it sir asked the matron  if she lasts a couple of hours i shall be surprised said the apothecarys apprentice intent upon the toothpicks point its a breakup of the system altogether  is she dozing old lady  the attendant stooped over the bed to ascertain and nodded in the affirmative  then perhaps shell go off in that way if you dont make a row said the young man  put the light on the floor  she wont see it there  the attendant did as she was told  shaking her head meanwhile to intimate that the woman would not die so easily having done so she resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse who had by this time returned  the mistress with an expression of impatience wrapped herself in her shawl and sat at the foot of the bed  the apothecarys apprentice having completed the manufacture of the toothpick planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it for ten minutes or so  when apparently growing rather dull he wished mrs corney joy of her job and took himself off on tiptoe  when they had sat in silence for some time the two old women rose from the bed and crouching over the fire held out their withered hands to catch the heat  the flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces and made their ugliness appear terrible as in this position they began to converse in a low voice  did she say any more anny dear while i was gone inquired the messenger  not a word replied the other  she plucked and tore at her arms for a little time but i held her hands and she soon dropped off  she hasnt much strength in her so i easily kept her quiet  i aint so weak for an old woman although i am on parish allowance no no  did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have demanded the first  i tried to get it down rejoined the other  but her teeth were tight set and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as i could do to get it back again  so i drank it and it did me good  looking cautiously round to ascertain that they were not overheard the two hags cowered nearer to the fire and chuckled heartily  i mind the time said the first speaker when she would have done the same and made rare fun of it afterwards  ay that she would rejoined the other she had a merry heart a many many beautiful corpses she laid out as nice and neat as waxwork  my old eyes have seen themay and those old hands touched them too for i have helped her scores of times  stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke the old creature shook them exultingly before her face and fumbling in her pocket brought out an old timediscoloured tin snuffbox from which she shook a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion and a few more into her own  while they were thus employed the matron who had been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor joined them by the fire and sharply asked how long she was to wait  not long mistress replied the second woman looking up into her face  we have none of us long to wait for death  patience patience hell be here soon enough for us all  hold your tongue you doting idiot said the matron sternly you martha tell me has she been in this way before  often answered the first woman  but will never be again added the second one that is shell never wake again but onceand mind mistress that wont be for long  long or short said the matron snappishly she wont find me here when she does wake take care both of you how you worry me again for nothing  its no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house die and i wontthats more mind that you impudent old harridans if you make a fool of me again ill soon cure you i warrant you  she was bouncing away when a cry from the two women who had turned towards the bed caused her to look round  the patient had raised herself upright and was stretching her arms towards them  whos that she cried in a hollow voice  hush hush said one of the women stooping over her  lie down lie down  ill never lie down again alive said the woman struggling i will tell her  come here  nearer  let me whisper in your ear  she clutched the matron by the arm and forcing her into a chair by the bedside was about to speak when looking round she caught sight of the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners  turn them away said the woman drowsily make haste make haste  the two old crones chiming in together began pouring out many piteous lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her when the superior pushed them from the room closed the door and returned to the bedside  on being excluded the old ladies changed their tone and cried through the keyhole that old sally was drunk which indeed was not unlikely since in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of ginandwater which had been privily administered in the openness of their hearts by the worthy old ladies themselves  now listen to me said the dying woman aloud as if making a great effort to revive one latent spark of energy  in this very roomin this very bedi once nursed a pretty young creetur that was brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking and all soiled with dust and blood  she gave birth to a boy and died  let me thinkwhat was the year again  never mind the year said the impatient auditor what about her  ay murmured the sick woman relapsing into her former drowsy state what about herwhat abouti know she cried jumping fiercely up her face flushed and her eyes starting from her headi robbed her so i did  she wasnt coldi tell you she wasnt cold when i stole it  stole what for gods sake cried the matron with a gesture as if she would call for help  it replied the woman laying her hand over the others mouth the only thing she had  she wanted clothes to keep her warm and food to eat but she had kept it safe and had it in her bosom  it was gold i tell you  rich gold that might have saved her life  gold echoed the matron bending eagerly over the woman as she fell back  go on go onyeswhat of it  who was the mother when was it  she charge me to keep it safe replied the woman with a groan and trusted me as the only woman about her  i stole it in my heart when she first showed it me hanging round her neck and the childs death perhaps is on me besides  they would have treated him better if they had known it all  known what asked the other  speak  the boy grew so like his mother said the woman rambling on and not heeding the question that i could never forget it when i saw his face  poor girl poor girl  she was so young too such a gentle lamb  wait theres more to tell  i have not told you all have i  no no replied the matron inclining her head to catch the words as they came more faintly from the dying woman  be quick or it may be too late  the mother said the woman making a more violent effort than before the mother when the pains of death first came upon her whispered in my ear that if her baby was born alive and thrived the day might come when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named and oh kind heaven she said folding her thin hands together whether it be boy or girl raise up some friends for it in this troubled world and take pity upon a lonely desolate child abandoned to its mercy  the boys name demanded the matron  they called him oliver replied the woman feebly  the gold i stole was  yes yeswhat cried the other  she was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply but drew back instinctively as she once again rose slowly and stiffly into a sitting posture then clutching the coverlid with both hands muttered some indistinct sounds in her throat and fell lifeless on the bed                                  stone dead said one of the old women hurrying in as soon as the door was opened  and nothing to tell after all rejoined the matron walking carelessly away  the two crones to all appearance too busily occupied in the preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply were left alone hovering about the body
