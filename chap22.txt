chapter xxi  the expedition  it was a cheerless morning when they got into the street blowing and raining hard and the clouds looking dull and stormy  the night had been very wet large pools of water had collected in the road and the kennels were overflowing  there was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the sky but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene  the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet housetops and dreary streets  there appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of the town the windows of the houses were all closely shut and the streets through which they passed were noiseless and empty  by the time they had turned into the bethnal green road the day had fairly begun to break  many of the lamps were already extinguished a few country waggons were slowly toiling on towards london now and then a stagecoach covered with mud rattled briskly by the driver bestowing as he passed an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who by keeping on the wrong side of the road had endangered his arriving at the office a quarter of a minute after his time  the publichouses with gaslights burning inside were already open  by degrees other shops began to be unclosed and a few scattered people were met with  then came straggling groups of labourers going to their work then men and women with fishbaskets on their heads donkeycarts laden with vegetables chaisecarts filled with livestock or whole carcasses of meat milkwomen with pails an unbroken concourse of people trudging out with various supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town  as they approached the city the noise and traffic gradually increased when they threaded the streets between shoreditch and smithfield it had swelled into a roar of sound and bustle  it was as light as it was likely to be till night came on again and the busy morning of half the london population had begun  turning down sun street and crown street and crossing finsbury square mr sikes struck by way of chiswell street into barbican thence into long lane and so into smithfield from which latter place arose a tumult of discordant sounds that filled oliver twist with amazement  it was marketmorning  the ground was covered nearly ankledeep with filth and mire a thick steam perpetually rising from the reeking bodies of the cattle and mingling with the fog which seemed to rest upon the chimneytops hung heavily above  all the pens in the centre of the large area and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant space were filled with sheep tied up to posts by the gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen three or four deep countrymen butchers drovers hawkers boys thieves idlers and vagabonds of every low grade were mingled together in a mass the whistling of drovers the barking dogs the bellowing and plunging of the oxen the bleating of sheep the grunting and squeaking of pigs the cries of hawkers the shouts oaths and quarrelling on all sides the ringing of bells and roar of voices that issued from every publichouse the crowding pushing driving beating whooping and yelling the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every corner of the market and the unwashed unshaven squalid and dirty figures constantly running to and fro and bursting in and out of the throng rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene which quite confounded the senses  mr sikes dragging oliver after him elbowed his way through the thickest of the crowd and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights and sounds which so astonished the boy  he nodded twice or thrice to a passing friend and resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram pressed steadily onward until they were clear of the turmoil and had made their way through hosier lane into holborn  now young un said sikes looking up at the clock of st andrews church hard upon seven you must step out  come dont lag behind already lazylegs  mr sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companions wrist oliver quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk and a run kept up with the rapid strides of the housebreaker as well as he could  they held their course at this rate until they had passed hyde park corner and were on their way to kensington  when sikes relaxed his pace until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind came up  seeing hounslow written on it he asked the driver with as much civility as he could assume if he would give them a lift as far as isleworth  jump up said the man  is that your boy  yes hes my boy replied sikes looking hard at oliver and putting his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was  your father walks rather too quick for you dont he my man inquired the driver seeing that oliver was out of breath  not a bit of it replied sikes interposing  hes used to it  here take hold of my hand ned  in with you  thus addressing oliver he helped him into the cart and the driver pointing to a heap of sacks told him to lie down there and rest himself  as they passed the different milestones oliver wondered more and more where his companion meant to take him  kensington hammersmith chiswick kew bridge brentford were all passed and yet they went on as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey  at length they came to a publichouse called the coach and horses a little way beyond which another road appeared to run off  and here the cart stopped  sikes dismounted with great precipitation holding oliver by the hand all the while and lifting him down directly bestowed a furious look upon him and rapped the sidepocket with his fist in a significant manner  goodbye boy said the man  hes sulky replied sikes giving him a shake hes sulky  a young dog  dont mind him  not i rejoined the other getting into his cart  its a fine day after all  and he drove away  sikes waited until he had fairly gone and then telling oliver he might look about him if he wanted once again led him onward on his journey  they turned round to the left a short way past the publichouse and then taking a righthand road walked on for a long time passing many large gardens and gentlemens houses on both sides of the way and stopping for nothing but a little beer until they reached a town here against the wall of a house oliver saw written up in pretty large letters hampton  they lingered about in the fields for some hours  at length they came back into the town and turning into an old publichouse with a defaced signboard ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire  the kitchen was an old lowroofed room with a great beam across the middle of the ceiling and benches with high backs to them by the fire on which were seated several rough men in smockfrocks drinking and smoking  they took no notice of oliver and very little of sikes and as sikes took very little notice of them he and his young comrade sat in a corner by themselves without being much troubled by their company  they had some cold meat for dinner and sat so long after it while mr sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes that oliver began to feel quite certain they were not going any further  being much tired with the walk and getting up so early he dozed a little at first then quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco fell asleep  it was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from sikes rousing himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him he found that worthy in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man over a pint of ale  so youre going on to lower halliford are you inquired sikes  yes i am replied the man who seemed a little the worseor better as the case might befor drinking and not slow about it neither  my horse hasnt got a load behind him going back as he had coming up in the mornin and he wont be long adoing of it  heres luck to him ecod hes a good un  could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there demanded sikes pushing the ale towards his new friend  if youre going directly i can replied the man looking out of the pot  are you going to halliford  going on to shepperton replied sikes  im your man as far as i go replied the other  is all paid becky  yes the other gentlemans paid replied the girl  i say said the man with tipsy gravity that wont do you know  why not rejoined sikes  youre agoing to accommodate us and wots to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so in return  the stranger reflected upon this argument with a very profound face having done so he seized sikes by the hand  and declared he was a real good fellow  to which mr sikes replied he was joking as if he had been sober there would have been strong reason to suppose he was  after the exchange of a few more compliments they bade the company goodnight and went out the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so and lounging out to the door with her hands full to see the party start  the horse whose health had been drunk in his absence was standing outside  ready harnessed to the cart  oliver and sikes got in without any further ceremony and the man to whom he belonged having lingered for a minute or two to bear him up and to defy the hostler and the world to produce his equal mounted also  then the hostler was told to give the horse his head and his head being given him he made a very unpleasant use of it  tossing it into the air with great disdain and running into the parlour windows over the way after performing those feats and supporting himself for a short time on his hindlegs he started off at great speed and rattled out of the town right gallantly  the night was very dark  a damp mist rose from the river and the marshy ground about and spread itself over the dreary fields  it was piercing cold too all was gloomy and black not a word was spoken for the driver had grown sleepy and sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation  oliver sat huddled together in a corner of the cart bewildered with alarm and apprehension and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees whose branches waved grimly to and fro as if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene  as they passed sunbury church the clock struck seven  there was a light in the ferryhouse window opposite  which streamed across the road and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yewtree with graves beneath it  there was a dull sound of falling water not far off and the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind  it seemed like quiet music for the repose of the dead  sunbury was passed through and they came again into the lonely road two or three miles more and the cart stopped  sikes alighted took oliver by the hand and they once again walked on  they turned into no house at shepperton as the weary boy had expected but still kept walking on in mud and darkness through gloomy lanes and over cold open wastes until they came within sight of the lights of a town at no great distance  on looking intently forward oliver saw that the water was just below them and that they were coming to the foot of a bridge  sikes kept straight on until they were close upon the bridge then turned suddenly down a bank upon the left  the water thought oliver turning sick with fear  he has brought me to this lonely place to murder me  he was about to throw himself on the ground and make one struggle for his young life when he saw that they stood before a solitary house all ruinous and decayed  there was a window on each side of the dilapidated entrance and one story above but no light was visible the house was dark dismantled and the all appearance uninhabited  sikes with olivers hand still in his softly approached the low porch and raised the latch  the door yielded to the pressure and they passed in together
