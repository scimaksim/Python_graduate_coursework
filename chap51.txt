chapter xlix  monks and mr brownlow at length meet  their conversation and the intelligence that interrupts it   the twilight was beginning to close in when mr brownlow alighted from a hackneycoach at his own door and knocked softly  the door being opened a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the steps while another man who had been seated on the box dismounted too and stood upon the other side  at a sign from mr brownlow they helped out a third man and taking him between them hurried him into the house this man was monks  they walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking and mr brownlow preceding them led the way into a backroom at the door of this apartment monks who had ascended with evident reluctance stopped  the two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions  he knows the alternative said mr browlow  if he hesitates or moves a finger but as you bid him drag him into the street call for the aid of the police and impeach him as a felon in my name  how dare you say this of me asked monks  how dare you urge me to it young man replied mr brownlow confronting him with a steady look  are you mad enough to leave this house  unhand him  there sir you are free to go and we to follow but i warn you by all i hold most solemn and most sacred that instant will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery  i am resolute and immoveable  if you are determined to be the same your blood be upon your own head  by what authority am i kidnapped in the street and brought here by these dogs asked monks looking from one to the other of the men who stood beside him  by mine replied mr brownlow  those persons are indemnified by me if you complain of being deprived of your libertyyou had power and opportunity to retrieve it as you came along but you deemed it advisable to remain quieti say again throw yourself for protection on the law  i will appeal to the law too but when you have gone too far to recede do not sue to me for leniency when the power will have passed into other hands and do not say i plunged you down the gulf into which you rushed yourself  monks was plainly disconcerted and alarmed besides  he hesitated  you will decide quickly said mr brownlow with perfect firmness and composure  if you wish me to prefer my charges publicly and consign you to a punishment the extent of which although i can with a shudder foresee i cannot control once more i say for you know the way  if not and you appeal to my forbearance and the mercy of those you have deeply injured seat yourself without a word in that chair it has waited for you two whole days  monks muttered some unintelligible words but wavered still  you will be prompt said mr brownlow  a word from me and the alternative has gone for ever  still the man hesitated  i have not the inclination to parley said mr brownlow and as i advocate the dearest interests of others i have not the right  is there demanded monks with a faltering tongueis thereno middle course  none  monks looked at the old gentleman with an anxious eye but reading in his countenance nothing but severity and determination walked into the room and shrugging his shoulders sat down  lock the door on the outside said mr brownlow to the attendants and come when i ring  the men obeyed and the two were left alone together  this is pretty treatment sir said monks throwing down his hat and cloak from my fathers oldest friend  it is because i was your fathers oldest friend young man returned mr brownlow it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years were bound up with him and that fair creature of his blood and kindred who rejoined her god in youth and left me here a solitary lonely man  it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters deathbed when he was yet a boy on the morning that wouldbut heaven willed otherwisehave made her my young wife it is because my seared heart clung to him from that time forth through all his trials and errors till he died it is because old recollections and associations filled my heart and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him it is because of all these things that i am moved to treat you gently nowyes edward leeford even nowand blush for your unworthiness who bear the name  what has the name to do with it asked the other after contemplating half in silence and half in dogged wonder the agitation of his companion  what is the name to me  nothing replied mr brownlow nothing to you  but it was hers and even at this distance of time brings back to me an old man the glow and thrill which i once felt only to hear it repeated by a stranger  i am very glad you have changed itveryvery  this is all mighty fine said monks to retain his assumed designation after a long silence during which he had jerked himself in sullen defiance to and fro and mr brownlow had sat shading his face with his hand but what do you want with me  you have a brother said mr brownlow rousing himself  a brother the whisper of whose name in your ear when i came behind you in the street was in itself almost enough to make you accompany me hither in wonder and alarm  i have no brother replied monks  you know i was an only child why do you talk to me of brothers  you know that as well as i  attend to what i do know and you may not said mr brownlow i shall interest you by and by  i know that of the wretched marriage into which family pride and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition forced your unhappy father when a mere boy you were the sole and most unnatural issue  i dont care for hard names interrupted monks with a jeering laugh you know the fact and thats enough for me  but i also know pursued the old gentleman the misery the slow torture the protracted anguish of that illassorted union i know how listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both  i know how cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts how indifference gave place to dislike dislike to hate and hate to loathing until at last they wrenched the clanking bond asunder and retiring a wide space apart carried each a galling fragment of which nothing but death could break the rivets to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could assume  your mother succeeded she forgot it soon but it rusted and cankered at your fathers heart for years  well they were separated said monks and what of that  when they had been separated for some time returned mr brownlow and your mother wholly given up to continental frivolities had utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior who with prospects blighted lingered on at home he fell among new friends  this circumstance at least you know already  not i said monks turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the ground as a man who is determined to deny everything not i  your manner no less than your actions assures me that you have never forgotten it or ceased to think of it with bitterness returned mr brownlow  i speak of fifteen years ago when you were not more than eleven years old and your father but oneandthirtyfor he was i repeat a boy when his father ordered him to marry must i go back to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent or will you spare it and disclose to me the truth  i have nothing to disclose rejoined monks  you must talk on if you will  these new friends then said mr brownlow were a naval officer retired from active service whose wife had died some halfayear before and left him with two childrenthere had been more but of all their family happily but two survived they were both daughters one a beautiful creature of nineteen and the other a mere child of two or three years old  whats this to me asked monks  they resided said mr brownlow without seeming to hear the interruption in a part of the country to which your father in his wandering had repaired and where he had taken up his abode acquaintance intimacy friendship fast followed on each other your father was gifted as few men are  he had his sisters soul and person as the old officer knew him more and more he grew to love him  i would that it had ended there  his daughter did the same  the old gentleman paused monks was biting his lips with his eyes fixed upon the floor seeing this he immediately resumed  the end of a year found him contracted solemnly contracted to that daughter the object of the first true ardent only passion of a guileless girl  your tale is of the longest observed monks moving restlessly in his chair  it is a true tale of grief and trial and sorrow young man returned mr brownlow and such tales usually are if it were one of unmixed joy and happiness it would be very brief  at length one of those rich relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been sacrificed as others are oftenit is no uncommon casedied and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning left him his panacea for all griefsmoney  it was necessary that he should immediately repair to rome whither this man had sped for health and where he had died leaving his affairs in great confusion  he went was seized with mortal illness there was followed the moment the intelligence reached paris by your mother who carried you with her he died the day after her arrival leaving no willno willso that the whole property fell to her and you  at this part of the recital monks held his breath and listened with a face of intense eagerness though his eyes were not directed towards the speaker  as mr brownlow paused he changed his position with the air of one who has experienced a sudden relief and wiped his hot face and hands  before he went abroad and as he passed through london on his way said mr brownlow slowly and fixing his eyes upon the others face he came to me  i never heard of that interrupted monks in a tone intended to appear incredulous but savouring more of disagreeable surprise  he came to me and left with me among some other things a picturea portrait painted by himselfa likeness of this poor girlwhich he did not wish to leave behind and could not carry forward on his hasty journey  he was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow talked in a wild distracted way of ruin and dishonour worked by himself confided to me his intention to convert his whole property at any loss into money and having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent acquisition to fly the countryi guessed too well he would not fly aloneand never see it more  even from me his old and early friend whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most dear to botheven from me he withheld any more particular confession promising to write and tell me all and after that to see me once again for the last time on earth alas  that was the last time  i had no letter and i never saw him more  i went said mr brownlow after a short pause i went when all was over to the scene of hisi will use the term the world would freely use for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to himof his guilty love resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her  the family had left that part a week before they had called in such trifling debts as were outstanding discharged them and left the place by night  why or whither none can tell  monks drew his breath yet more freely and looked round with a smile of triumph  when your brother said mr brownlow drawing nearer to the others chair when your brother  a feeble ragged neglected child  was cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance and rescued by me from a life of vice and infamy  what cried monks  by me said mr brownlow  i told you i should interest you before long  i say by mei see that your cunning associate suppressed my name although for ought he knew it would be quite strange to your ears  when he was rescued by me then and lay recovering from sickness in my house his strong resemblance to this picture i have spoken of struck me with astonishment  even when i first saw him in all his dirt and misery there was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream  i need not tell you he was snared away before i knew his history  why not asked monks hastily  because you know it well  i  denial to me is vain replied mr brownlow  i shall show you that i know more than that  youyoucant prove anything against me stammered monks  i defy you to do it  we shall see returned the old gentleman with a searching glance  i lost the boy and no efforts of mine could recover him  your mother being dead i knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could and as when i had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the west indieswhither as you well know you retired upon your mothers death to escape the consequences of vicious courses herei made the voyage  you had left it months before and were supposed to be in london but no one could tell where  i returned  your agents had no clue to your residence  you came and went they said as strangely as you had ever done  sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months  keeping to all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy  i wearied them with new applications  i paced the streets by night and day but until two hours ago all my efforts were fruitless and i never saw you for an instant  and now you do see me said monks rising boldly what then fraud and robbery are highsounding wordsjustified you think by a fancied resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead mans brother you dont even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair you dont even know that  i did not replied mr brownlow rising too but within the last fortnight i have learnt it all  you have a brother you know it and him  there was a will which your mother destroyed leaving the secret and the gain to you at her own death  it contained a reference to some child likely to be the result of this sad connection which child was born and accidentally encountered by you when your suspicions were first awakened by his resemblance to your father  you repaired to the place of his birth there existed proofsproofs long suppressedof his birth and parentage  those proofs were destroyed by you and now in your own words to your accomplice the jew the only proofs of the boys identity lie at the bottom of the river and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin unworthy son coward liaryou who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at nightyou whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as youyou who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own fathers heart and in whom all evil passions vice and profligacy festered till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an index even to your mindyou edward leeford do you still brave me  no no no returned the coward overwhelmed by these accumulated charges  every word cried the gentleman every word that has passed between you and this detested villain is known to me  shadows on the wall have caught your whispers and brought them to my ear the sight of the persecuted child has turned vice itself and given it the courage and almost the attributes of virtue murder has been done to which you were morally if not really a party  no no interposed monks  ii knew nothing of that i was going to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me  i didnt know the cause  i thought it was a common quarrel  it was the partial disclosure of your secrets replied mr brownlow will you disclose the whole  yes i will  set your hand to a statement of truth and facts and repeat it before witnesses  that i promise too  remain quietly here until such a document is drawn up and proceed with me to such a place as i may deem most advisable for the purpose of attesting it  if you insist upon that ill do that also replied monks  you must do more than that said mr brownlow  make restitution to an innocent and unoffending child for such he is although the offspring of a guilty and most miserable love  you have not forgotten the provisions of the will  carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned and then go where you please  in this world you need meet no more  while monks was pacing up and down meditating with dark and evil looks on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it  torn by his fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other  the door was hurriedly unlocked and a gentleman mr losberne entered the room in violent agitation  the man will be taken he cried  he will be taken tonight  the murderer asked mr brownlow  yes yes replied the other  his dog has been seen lurking about some old haunt and there seems little doubt that his master either is or will be there under cover of the darkness  spies are hovering about in every direction  i have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture and they tell me he cannot escape  a reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed by government tonight  i will give fifty more said mr brownlow and proclaim it with my own lips upon the spot if i can reach it  where is mr maylie  harry  as soon as he had seen your friend here safe in a coach with you he hurried off to where he heard this replied the doctor and mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the outskirts agreed upon between them  fagin said mr brownlow what of him  when i last heard he had not been taken but he will be or is by this time  theyre sure of him  have you made up your mind asked mr brownlow in a low voice of monks  yes he replied  youyouwill be secret with me  i will  remain here till i return  it is your only hope of safety  they left the room and the door was again locked  what have you done asked the doctor in a whisper  all that i could hope to do and even more  coupling the poor girls intelligence with my previous knowledge and the result of our good friends inquiries on the spot i left him no loophole of escape and laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day write and appoint the evening after tomorrow at seven for the meeting  we shall be down there a few hours before but shall require rest  especially the young lady who may have greater need of firmness than either you or i can quite foresee just now  but my blood boils to avenge this poor murdered creature  which way have they taken  drive straight to the office and you will be in time replied mr losberne  i will remain here  the two gentlemen hastily separated each in a fever of excitement wholly uncontrollable
