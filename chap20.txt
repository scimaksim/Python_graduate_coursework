chapter xix  in which a notable plan is discussed and determined on  it was a chill damp windy night when the jew buttoning his greatcoat tight round his shrivelled body and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face emerged from his den  he paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him and having listened while the boys made all secure and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible slunk down the street as quickly as he could  the house to which oliver had been conveyed was in the neighborhood of whitechapel  the jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street and glancing suspiciously round crossed the road and struck off in the direction of the spitalfields  the mud lay thick upon the stones and a black mist hung over the streets the rain fell sluggishly down and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch  it seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the jew to be abroad  as he glided stealthily along creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved crawling forth by night in search of some rich offal for a meal  he kept on his course through many winding and narrow ways until he reached bethnal green then turning suddenly off to the left he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and denselypopulated quarter  the jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered either by the darkness of the night or the intricacies of the way  he hurried through several alleys and streets and at length turned into one lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end  at the door of a house in this street he knocked having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it he walked upstairs  a dog growled as he touched the handle of a roomdoor and a mans voice demanded who was there  only me bill only me my dear said the jew looking in  bring in your body then said sikes  lie down you stupid brute dont you know the devil when hes got a greatcoat on  apparently the dog had been somewhat deceived by mr fagins outer garment for as the jew unbuttoned it and threw it over the back of a chair he retired to the corner from which he had risen  wagging his tail as he went to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be  well said sikes  well my dear replied the jewah nancy  the latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception for mr fagin and his young friend had not met since she had interfered in behalf of oliver  all doubts upon the subject if he had any were speedily removed by the young ladys behaviour  she took her feet off the fender pushed back her chair and bade fagin draw up his without saying more about it  for it was a cold night and no mistake  it is cold nancy dear said the jew as he warmed his skinny hands over the fire  it seems to go right through one added the old man touching his side  it must be a piercer if it finds its way through your heart said mr sikes  give him something to drink nancy  burn my body make haste  its enough to turn a man ill to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave  nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard in which there were many  which to judge from the diversity of their appearance were filled with several kinds of liquids  sikes pouring out a glass of brandy bade the jew drink it off  quite enough quite thankye bill replied the jew putting down the glass after just setting his lips to it  what  youre afraid of our getting the better of you are you inquired sikes fixing his eyes on the jew  ugh  with a hoarse grunt of contempt mr sikes seized the glass and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself  which he did at once  the jew glanced round the room as his companion tossed down the second glassful not in curiousity for he had seen it often before but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him it was a meanly furnished apartment with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner and a lifepreserver that hung over the chimneypiece  there said sikes smacking his lips now im ready  for business inquired the jew  for business replied sikes so say what youve got to say  about the crib at chertsey bill said the jew drawing his chair forward and speaking in a very low voice  yes  wot about it inquired sikes  ah you know what i mean my dear said the jew  he knows what i mean nancy dont he  no he dont sneered mr sikes  or he wont and thats the same thing  speak out and call things by their right names dont sit there winking and blinking and talking to me in hints as if you warnt the very first that thought about the robbery  wot dye mean  hush bill hush said the jew who had in vain attempted to stop this burst of indignation somebody will hear us my dear somebody will hear us  let em hear said sikes i dont care  but as mr sikes did care on reflection he dropped his voice as he said the words and grew calmer  there there said the jew coaxingly  it was only my caution nothing more  now my dear about that crib at chertsey when is it to be done bill eh  when is it to be done  such plate my dear such plate said the jew  rubbing his hands and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of anticipation  not at all replied sikes coldly  not to be done at all echoed the jew leaning back in his chair  no not at all rejoined sikes  at least it cant be a putup job as we expected  then it hasnt been properly gone about said the jew turning pale with anger  dont tell me  but i will tell you retorted sikes  who are you thats not to be told  i tell you that toby crackit has been hanging about the place for a fortnight and he cant get one of the servants in line  do you mean to tell me bill said the jew softening as the other grew heated  that neither of the two men in the house can be got over  yes i do mean to tell you so replied sikes  the old lady has had em these twenty years and if you were to give em five hundred pound they wouldnt be in it  but do you mean to say my dear remonstrated the jew that the women cant be got over  not a bit of it replied sikes  not by flash toby crackit said the jew incredulously think what women are bill  no not even by flash toby crackit replied sikes  he says hes worn sham whiskers and a canary waistcoat the whole blessed time hes been loitering down there and its all of no use  he should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers my dear said the jew  so he did rejoined sikes and they warnt of no more use than the other plant  the jew looked blank at this information  after ruminating for some minutes with his chin sunk on his breast he raised his head and said with a deep sigh that if flash toby crackit reported aright he feared the game was up  and yet said the old man dropping his hands on his knees its a sad thing my dear to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it  so it is said mr sikes  worse luck  a long silence ensued during which the jew was plunged in deep thought with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal  sikes eyed him furtively from time to time nancy apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker sat with her eyes fixed upon the fire as if she had been deaf to all that passed  fagin said sikes abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed is it worth fifty shiners extra if its safely done from the outside  yes said the jew as suddenly rousing himself  is it a bargain inquired sikes  yes my dear yes rejoined the jew his eyes glistening and every muscle in his face working with the excitement that the inquiry had awakened  then said sikes thrusting aside the jews hand with some disdain let it come off as soon as you like  toby and me were over the gardenwall the night afore last sounding the panels of the door and shutters  the cribs barred up at night like a jail but theres one part we can crack safe and softly  which is that bill asked the jew eagerly  why whispered sikes as you cross the lawn  yes said the jew bending his head forward with his eyes almost starting out of it  umph cried sikes stopping short as the girl scarcely moving her head looked suddenly round and pointed for an instant to the jews face  never mind which part it is you cant do it without me i know but its best to be on the safe side when one deals with you  as you like my dear as you like replied the jew  is there no help wanted but yours and tobys  none said sikes  cept a centrebit and a boy  the first weve both got the second you must find us  a boy exclaimed the jew  oh then its a panel eh  never mind wot it is replied sikes  i want a boy and he musnt be a big un  lord said mr sikes reflectively if id only got that young boy of ned the chimbleysweepers  he kept him small on purpose and let him out by the job  but the father gets lagged and then the juvenile delinquent society comes and takes the boy away from a trade where he was earning money teaches him to read and write and in time makes a prentice of him  and so they go on said mr sikes his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs so they go on and if theyd got money enough which its a providence they havent we shouldnt have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade in a year or two  no more we should acquiesced the jew who had been considering during this speech and had only caught the last sentence bill  what now inquired sikes  the jew nodded his head towards nancy who was still gazing at the fire and intimated by a sign that he would have her told to leave the room  sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently as if he thought the precaution unnecessary but complied nevertheless by requesting miss nancy to fetch him a jug of beer  you dont want any beer said nancy folding her arms and retaining her seat very composedly  i tell you i do replied sikes  nonsense rejoined the girl coolly go on fagin  i know what hes going to say bill he neednt mind me  the jew still hesitated  sikes looked from one to the other in some surprise  why you dont mind the old girl do you fagin he asked at length youve known her long enough to trust her or the devils in it  she aint one to blab  are you nancy  i should think not replied the young lady  drawing her chair up to the table and putting her elbows upon it  no no my dear i know youre not said the jew but and again the old man paused  but wot inquired sikes  i didnt know whether she mightnt praps be out of sorts you know my dear as she was the other night replied the jew  at this confession miss nancy burst into a loud laugh and swallowing a glass of brandy shook her head with an air of defiance and burst into sundry exclamations of keep the game agoing  never say die and the like  these seemed to have the effect of reassuring both gentlemen for the jew nodded his head with a satisfied air and resumed his seat as did mr sikes likewise  now fagin said nancy with a laugh  tell bill at once about oliver  ha youre a clever one my dear the sharpest girl i ever saw said the jew patting her on the neck  it was about oliver i was going to speak sure enough  ha ha ha  what about him demanded sikes  hes the boy for you my dear replied the jew in a hoarse whisper laying his finger on the side of his nose and grinning frightfully  he exclaimed sikes  have him bill said nancy  i would if i was in your place he maynt be so much up as any of the others but thats not what you want if hes only to open a door for you  depend upon it hes a safe one bill  i know he is rejoined fagin  hes been in good training these last few weeks and its time he began to work for his bread  besides the others are all too big  well he is just the size i want said mr sikes ruminating  and will do everything you want bill my dear interposed the jew he cant help himself  that is if you frighten him enough  frighten him echoed sikes  itll be no sham frightening mind you if theres anything queer about him when we once get into the work in for a penny in for a pound  you wont see him alive again fagin think of that before you send him  mark my words said the robber poising a crowbar which he had drawn from under the bedstead  ive thought of it all said the jew with energy iveive had my eye upon him my dears closeclose once let him feel that he is one of us once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief and hes ours  ours for his life  oho  it couldnt have come about better  the old man crossed his arms upon his breast and drawing his head and shoulders into a heap literally hugged himself for joy  ours said sikes  yours you mean  perhaps i do my dear said the jew with a shrill chuckle mine if you like bill  and wot said sikes scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend wot makes you take so much pains about one chalkfaced kid when you know there are fifty boys snoozing about common garden every night as you might pick and choose from  because theyre of no use to me my dear replied the jew with some confusion not worth the taking  their looks convict em when they get into trouble and i lose em all  with this boy properly managed my dears i could do what i couldnt with twenty of them  besides said the jew recovering his selfpossession he has us now if he could only give us legbail again and he must be in the same boat with us  never mind how he came there its quite enough for my power over him that he was in a robbery thats all i want  now how much better this is than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the waywhich would be dangerous and we should lose by it besides  when is it to be done asked nancy stopping some turbulent exclamation on the part of mr sikes expressive of the disgust with which he received fagins affectation of humanity  ah to be sure said the jew when is it to be done bill  i planned with toby the night arter tomorrow rejoined sikes in a surly voice if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy  good said the jew theres no moon  no rejoined sikes  its all arranged about bringing off the swag is it asked the jew  sikes nodded  and about  oh ah its all planned rejoined sikes interrupting him never mind particulars  youd better bring the boy here tomorrow night  i shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak  then you hold your tongue and keep the meltingpot ready and thats all youll have to do  after some discussion in which all three took an active part it was decided that nancy should repair to the jews next evening when the night had set in and bring oliver away with her fagin craftily observing that if he evinced any disinclination to the task he would be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his behalf than anybody else  it was also solemnly arranged that poor oliver should for the purposes of the contemplated expedition be unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of mr william sikes and further that the said sikes should deal with him as he thought fit and should not be held responsible by the jew for any mischance or evil that might be necessary to visit him it being understood that to render the compact in this respect binding any representations made by mr sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and corroborated in all important particulars by the testimony of flash toby crackit  these preliminaries adjusted mr sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a furious rate and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner yelling forth at the same time most unmusical snatches of song mingled with wild execrations  at length in a fit of professional enthusiasm he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools which he had no sooner stumbled in with and opened for the purpose of explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it contained and the peculiar beauties of their construction than he fell over the box upon the floor and went to sleep where he fell  goodnight nancy said the jew muffling himself up as before  goodnight  their eyes met and the jew scrutinised her narrowly  there was no flinching about the girl  she was as true and earnest in the matter as toby crackit himself could be  the jew again bade her goodnight and bestowing a sly kick upon the prostrate form of mr sikes while her back was turned groped downstairs  always the way muttered the jew to himself as he turned homeward the worst of these women is that a very little thing serves to call up some longforgotten feeling and the best of them is that it never lasts  ha ha  the man against the child for a bag of gold  beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections mr fagin wended his way through mud and mire to his gloomy abode  where the dodger was sitting up impatiently awaiting his return  is oliver abed  i want to speak to him was his first remark as they descended the stairs  hours ago replied the dodger throwing open a door  here he is  the boy was lying fast asleep on a rude bed upon the floor so pale with anxiety and sadness and the closeness of his prison that he looked like death not death as it shows in shroud and coffin but in the guise it wears when life has just departed when a young and gentle spirit has but an instant fled to heaven and the gross air of the world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed  not now said the jew turning softly away  tomorrow tomorrow
