chapter xii  in which oliver is taken better care of than he ever was before and in which the narrative reverts to the merry old gentleman and his youthful friends  the coach rattled away over nearly the same ground as that which oliver had traversed when he first entered london in company with the dodger and turning a different way when it reached the angel at islington stopped at length before a neat house in a quiet shady street near pentonville  here a bed was prepared without loss of time in which mr brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited and here he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds  but for many days oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his new friends  the sun rose and sank and rose and sank again and many times after that and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever  the worm does not work more surely on the dead body than does this slow creeping fire upon the living frame  weak and thin and pallid he awoke at last from what seemed to have been a long and troubled dream  feebly raising himself in the bed with his head resting on his trembling arm he looked anxiously around  what room is this  where have i been brought to said oliver this is not the place i went to sleep in  he uttered these words in a feeble voice being very faint and weak but they were overheard at once  the curtain at the beds head was hastily drawn back and a motherly old lady very neatly and precisely dressed rose as she undrew it from an armchair close by in which she had been sitting at needlework  hush my dear said the old lady softly  you must be very quiet or you will be ill again and you have been very badas bad as bad could be pretty nigh  lie down again theres a dear  with those words the old lady very gently placed olivers head upon the pillow and smoothing back his hair from his forehead looked so kindly and loving in his face that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers and drawing it round his neck  save us said the old lady with tears in her eyes  what a grateful little dear it is  pretty creetur  what would his mother feel if she had sat by him as i have and could see him now  perhaps she does see me whispered oliver folding his hands together perhaps she has sat by me  i almost feel as if she had  that was the fever my dear said the old lady mildly  i suppose it was replied oliver because heaven is a long way off and they are too happy there to come down to the bedside of a poor boy  but if she knew i was ill she must have pitied me even there for she was very ill herself before she died  she cant know anything about me though added oliver after a moments silence  if she had seen me hurt it would have made her sorrowful and her face has always looked sweet and happy when i have dreamed of her  the old lady made no reply to this but wiping her eyes first and her spectacles which lay on the counterpane afterwards as if they were part and parcel of those features brought some cool stuff for oliver to drink and then patting him on the cheek told him he must lie very quiet or he would be ill again  so oliver kept very still partly because he was anxious to obey the kind old lady in all things and partly to tell the truth because he was completely exhausted with what he had already said  he soon fell into a gentle doze from which he was awakened by the light of a candle  which being brought near the bed showed him a gentleman with a very large and loudticking gold watch in his hand who felt his pulse and said he was a great deal better  you are a great deal better are you not my dear said the gentleman  yes thank you sir replied oliver  yes  i know you are said the gentleman  youre hungry too ant you  no sir answered oliver  hem said the gentleman  no i know youre not  he is not hungry mrs bedwin said the gentleman  looking very wise  the old lady made a respectful inclination of the head which seemed to say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man the doctor appeared much of the same opinion himself  you feel sleepy dont you my dear said the doctor  no sir replied oliver  no said the doctor with a very shrewd and satisfied look youre not sleepy  nor thirsty  are you  yes sir rather thirsty answered oliver  just as i expected mrs bedwin said the doctor  its very natural that he should be thirsty  you may give him a little tea maam and some dry toast without any butter  dont keep him too warm maam but be careful that you dont let him be too cold will you have the goodness  the old lady dropped a curtsey  the doctor after tasting the cool stuff and expressing a qualified approval of it hurried away  his boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs  oliver dozed off again soon after this when he awoke it was nearly twelve oclock  the old lady tenderly bade him goodnight shortly afterwards and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come  bringing with her in a little bundle a small prayer book and a large nightcap putting the latter on her head and the former on the table the old woman after telling oliver that she had come to sit up with him drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward and divers moans and chokings these however had no worse effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard and then fall asleep again  and thus the night crept slowly on  oliver lay awake for some time counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the rushlightshade threw upon the ceiling or tracing with his languid eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall the darkness and the deep stillness of the room were very solemn as they brought into the boys mind the thought that death had been hovering there for many days and nights and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful presence he turned his face upon the pillow and fervently prayed to heaven  gradually he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent suffering alone imparts that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to wake from  who if this were death would be roused again to all the struggles and turmoils of life to all its cares for the present its anxieties for the future more than all its weary recollections of the past  it had been bright day for hours when oliver opened his eyes he felt cheerful and happy  the crisis of the disease was safely past  he belonged to the world again  in three days time he was able to sit in an easychair well propped up with pillows and as he was still too weak to walk mrs bedwin had him carried downstairs into the little housekeepers room which belonged to her  having him set here by the fireside the good old lady sat herself down too and being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so much better forthwith began to cry most violently  never mind me my dear said the old lady im only having a regular good cry  there its all over now and im quite comfortable  youre very very kind to me maam said oliver  well never you mind that my dear said the old lady thats got nothing to do with your broth and its full time you had it for the doctor says mr brownlow may come in to see you this morning and we must get up our best looks because the better we look the more hell be pleased  and with this the old lady applied herself to warming up in a little saucepan a basin full of broth  strong enough oliver thought to furnish an ample dinner when reduced to the regulation strength for three hundred and fifty paupers at the lowest computation  are you fond of pictures dear inquired the old lady seeing that oliver had fixed his eyes most intently on a portrait which hung against the wall just opposite his chair  i dont quite know maam said oliver without taking his eyes from the canvas i have seen so few that i hardly know  what a beautiful mild face that ladys is  ah said the old lady painters always make ladies out prettier than they are or they wouldnt get any custom child the man that invented the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never succeed its a deal too honest  a deal said the old lady laughing very heartily at her own acuteness  isis that a likeness maam said oliver  yes said the old lady looking up for a moment from the broth thats a portrait  whose maam asked oliver  why really my dear i dont know answered the old lady in a goodhumoured manner  its not a likeness of anybody that you or i know i expect  it seems to strike your fancy dear  it is so pretty replied oliver  why sure youre not afraid of it said the old lady observing in great surprise the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting  oh no no returned oliver quickly but the eyes look so sorrowful and where i sit they seem fixed upon me  it makes my heart beat added oliver in a low voice as if it was alive and wanted to speak to me but couldnt  lord save us exclaimed the old lady starting dont talk in that way child  youre weak and nervous after your illness let me wheel your chair round to the other side and then you wont see it  there said the old lady suiting the action to the word you dont see it now at all events  oliver did see it in his minds eye as distinctly as if he had not altered his position but he thought it better not to worry the kind old lady so he smiled gently when she looked at him and mrs bedwin satisfied that he felt more comfortable salted and broke bits of toasted bread into the broth with all the bustle befitting so solemn a preparation oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition  he had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful when there came a soft rap at the door  come in said the old lady and in walked mr brownlow  now the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be but he had no sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead and thrust his hands behind the skirts of his dressinggown to take a good long look at oliver than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions  oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness and made an ineffectual attempt to stand up out of respect to his benefactor which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again and the fact is if the truth must be told that mr brownlows heart being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition forced a supply of tears into his eyes by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a condition to explain  poor boy poor boy said mr brownlow clearing his throat im rather hoarse this morning mrs bedwin  im afraid i have caught cold  i hope not sir said mrs bedwin  everything you have had has been well aired sir  i dont know bedwin  i dont know said mr brownlow i rather think i had a damp napkin at dinnertime yesterday but never mind that  how do you feel my dear  very happy sir replied oliver  and very grateful indeed sir for your goodness to me  good by said mr brownlow stoutly  have you given him any nourishment bedwin  any slops eh  he has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth sir replied mrs bedwin  drawing herself up slightly and laying strong emphasis on the last word  to intimate that between slops and broth will compounded there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever  ugh said mr brownlow with a slight shudder a couple of glasses of port wine would have done him a great deal more good wouldnt they tom white eh  my name is oliver sir replied the little invalid  with a look of great astonishment  oliver said mr brownlow oliver what  oliver white eh  no sir twist oliver twist  queer name said the old gentleman  what made you tell the magistrate your name was white  i never told him so sir returned oliver in amazement  this sounded so like a falsehood that the old gentleman looked somewhat sternly in olivers face  it was impossible to doubt him there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments  some mistake said mr brownlow  but although his motive for looking steadily at oliver no longer existed the old idea of the resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly that he could not withdraw his gaze  i hope you are not angry with me sir said oliver raising his eyes beseechingly  no no replied the old gentleman  why whats this  bedwin look there  as he spoke he pointed hastily to the picture over olivers head and then to the boys face  there was its living copy the eyes the head the mouth every feature was the same the expression was for the instant so precisely alike that the minutest line seemed copied with startling accuracy  oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation for not being strong enough to bear the start it gave him he fainted away  a weakness on his part which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the reader from suspense in behalf of the two young pupils of the merry old gentleman and of recording  that when the dodger and his accomplished friend master bates joined in the hueandcry which was raised at olivers heels in consequence of their executing an illegal conveyance of mr brownlows personal property as has been already described they were actuated by a very laudable and becoming regard for themselves and forasmuch as the freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest boasts of a truehearted englishman so i need hardly beg the reader to observe that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men in almost as great a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and soundjudging philosophers have laid down as the mainsprings of all natures deeds and actions  the said philosophers very wisely reducing the good ladys proceedings to matters of maxim and theory  and by a very neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart or generous impulse and feeling for these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and weaknesses of her sex  if i wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament i should at once find it in the fact also recorded in a foregoing part of this narrative of their quitting the pursuit when the general attention was fixed upon oliver and making immediately for their home by the shortest possible cut  although i do not mean to assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages to shorten the road to any great conclusion their course indeed being rather to lengthen the distance by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings like unto those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas are prone to indulge still i do mean to say and do say distinctly that it is the invariable practice of many mighty philosophers in carrying out their theories to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect themselves  thus to do a great right you may do a little wrong and you may take any means which the end to be attained will justify the amount of the right or the amount of the wrong or indeed the distinction between the two being left entirely to the philosopher concerned to be settled and determined by his clear comprehensive and impartial view of his own particular case  it was not until the two boys had scoured with great rapidity through a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts that they ventured to halt beneath a low and dark archway  having remained silent here just long enough to recover breath to speak master bates uttered an exclamation of amusement and delight and bursting into an uncontrollable fit of laughter flung himself upon a doorstep and rolled thereon in a transport of mirth  whats the matter inquired the dodger  ha ha ha roared charley bates  hold your noise remonstrated the dodger looking cautiously round do you want to be grabbed stupid  i cant help it said charley i cant help it  to see him splitting away at that pace and cutting round the corners and knocking up again the posts and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as them and me with the wipe in my pocket singing out arter himoh my eye the vivid imagination of master bates presented the scene before him in too strong colours  as he arrived at this apostrophe he again rolled upon the doorstep and laughed louder than before  whatll fagin say inquired the dodger taking advantage of the next interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the question  what repeated charley bates  ah what said the dodger  why what should he say inquired charley  stopping rather suddenly in his merriment for the dodgers manner was impressive  what should he say  mr dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes then taking off his hat scratched his head and nodded thrice  what do you mean said charley  toor rul lol loo gammon and spinnage the frog he wouldnt and high cockolorum said the dodger  with a slight sneer on his intellectual countenance  this was explanatory but not satisfactory  master bates felt it so and again said what do you mean  the dodger made no reply but putting his hat on again and gathering the skirts of his longtailed coat under his arm thrust his tongue into his cheek slapped the bridge of his nose some halfdozen times in a familiar but expressive manner and turning on his heel slunk down the court  master bates followed with a thoughtful countenance  the noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs a few minutes after the occurrence of this conversation roused the merry old gentleman as he sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand a pocketknife in his right and a pewter pot on the trivet  there was a rascally smile on his white face as he turned round and looking sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows bent his ear towards the door and listened  why hows this muttered the jew  changing countenance only two of em  wheres the third  they cant have got into trouble  hark  the footsteps approached nearer they reached the landing the door was slowly opened and the dodger and charley bates entered closing it behind them
