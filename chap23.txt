chapter xxii  the burglary  hallo cried a loud hoarse voice as soon as they set foot in the passage  dont make such a row said sikes bolting the door  show a glim toby  aha my pal cried the same voice  a glim barney a glim show the gentleman in barney wake up first if convenient  the speaker appeared to throw a bootjack or some such article at the person he addressed to rouse him from his slumbers  for the noise of a wooden body falling violently was heard and then an indistinct muttering as of a man between sleep and awake  do you hear cried the same voice  theres bill sikes in the passage with nobody to do the civil to him and you sleeping there as if you took laudanum with your meals and nothing stronger  are you any fresher now or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly  a pair of slipshod feet shuffled hastily across the bare floor of the room as this interrogatory was put and there issued from a door on the right hand first a feeble candle  and next the form of the same individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the infirmity of speaking through his nose and officiating as waiter at the publichouse on saffron hill  bister sikes exclaimed barney with real or counterfeit joy cub id sir cub id  here you get on first said sikes putting oliver in front of him quicker or i shall tread upon your heels  muttering a curse upon his tardiness sikes pushed oliver before him and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire two or three broken chairs a table and a very old couch  on which with his legs much higher than his head a man was reposing at full length smoking a long clay pipe  he was dressed in a smartlycut snuffcoloured coat with large brass buttons an orange neckerchief a coarse staring shawlpattern waistcoat and drab breeches  mr crackit for he it was had no very great quantity of hair either upon his head or face but what he had was of a reddish dye and tortured into long corkscrew curls through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers ornamented with large common rings  he was a trifle above the middle size and apparently rather weak in the legs but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own admiration of his topboots which he contemplated in their elevated situation with lively satisfaction  bill my boy said this figure turning his head towards the door im glad to see you  i was almost afraid youd given it up  in which case i should have made a personal wentur  hallo  uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise as his eyes rested on oliver mr toby crackit brought himself into a sitting posture and demanded who that was  the boy  only the boy replied sikes drawing a chair towards the fire  wud of bister fagids lads exclaimed barney with a grin  fagins eh exclaimed toby looking at oliver  wot an inwalable boy thatll make for the old ladies pockets in chapels  his mug is a fortin to him  theretheres enough of that interposed sikes impatiently and stooping over his recumbant friend he whispered a few words in his ear  at which mr crackit laughed immensely and honoured oliver with a long stare of astonishment  now said sikes as he resumed his seat if youll give us something to eat and drink while were waiting youll put some heart in us or in me at all events  sit down by the fire younker and rest yourself for youll have to go out with us again tonight though not very far off  oliver looked at sikes in mute and timid wonder and drawing a stool to the fire sat with his aching head upon his hands scarecely knowing where he was or what was passing around him  here said toby as the young jew placed some fragments of food and a bottle upon the table  success to the crack  he rose to honour the toast and carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner advanced to the table filled a glass with spirits and drank off its contents  mr sikes did the same  a drain for the boy said toby halffilling a wineglass down with it innocence  indeed said oliver looking piteously up into the mans face indeed i  down with it echoed toby  do you think i dont know whats good for you  tell him to drink it bill  he had better said sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket burn my body if he isnt more trouble than a whole family of dodgers  drink it you perwerse imp drink it  frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men oliver hastily swallowed the contents of the glass and immediately fell into a violent fit of coughing  which delighted toby crackit and barney and even drew a smile from the surly mr sikes  this done and sikes having satisfied his appetite oliver could eat nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow the two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap  oliver retained his stool by the fire barney wrapped in a blanket stretched himself on the floor  close outside the fender  they slept or appeared to sleep for some time nobody stirring but barney who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire oliver fell into a heavy doze  imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes or wandering about the dark churchyard or retracing some one or other of the scenes of the past day  when he was roused by toby crackit jumping up and declaring it was halfpast one  in an instant the other two were on their legs and all were actively engaged in busy preparation  sikes and his companion enveloped their necks and chins in large dark shawls and drew on their greatcoats barney opening a cupboard brought forth several articles which he hastily crammed into the pockets  barkers for me barney said toby crackit  here they are replied barney producing a pair of pistols you loaded them yourself  all right replied toby stowing them away  the persuaders  ive got em replied sikes  crape keys centrebits darkiesnothing forgotten inquired toby fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat  all right rejoined his companion  bring them bits of timber barney  thats the time of day  with these words he took a thick stick from barneys hands who having delivered another to toby busied himself in fastening on olivers cape  now then said sikes holding out his hand  oliver  who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise and the air and the drink which had been forced upon him  put his hand mechanically into that which sikes extended for the purpose  take his other hand toby said sikes  look out barney  the man went to the door and returned to announce that all was quiet the two robbers issued forth with oliver between them barney having made all fast rolled himself up as before and was soon asleep again  it was now intensely dark  the fog was much heavier than it had been in the early part of the night and the atmosphere was so damp that although no rain fell olivers hair and eyebrows within a few minutes after leaving the house had become stiff with the halffrozen moisture that was floating about  they crossed the bridge and kept on towards the lights which he had seen before  they were at no great distance off and as they walked pretty briskly they soon arrived at chertsey  slap through the town whispered sikes therell be nobody in the way tonight to see us  toby acquiesced and they hurried through the main street of the little town which at that late hour was wholly deserted  a dim light shone at intervals from some bedroom window and the hoarse barking of dogs occasionally broke the silence of the night  but there was nobody abroad  they had cleared the town as the churchbell struck two  quickening their pace they turned up a road upon the left hand after walking about a quarter of a mile they stopped before a detached house surrounded by a wall  to the top of which toby crackit scarcely pausing to take breath climbed in a twinkling  the boy next said toby  hoist him up ill catch hold of him  before oliver had time to look round sikes had caught him under the arms and in three or four seconds he and toby were lying on the grass on the other side  sikes followed directly  and they stole cautiously towards the house  and now for the first time oliver wellnigh mad with grief and terror saw that housebreaking and robbery if not murder were the objects of the expedition  he clasped his hands together and involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror  a mist came before his eyes the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face his limbs failed him and he sank upon his knees  get up murmured sikes trembling with rage and drawing the pistol from his pocket get up or ill strew your brains upon the grass  oh for gods sake let me go cried oliver let me run away and die in the fields  i will never come near london never never  oh pray have mercy on me and do not make me steal  for the love of all the bright angels that rest in heaven have mercy upon me  the man to whom this appeal was made swore a dreadful oath and had cocked the pistol when toby striking it from his grasp placed his hand upon the boys mouth and dragged him to the house  hush cried the man it wont answer here  say another word and ill do your business myself with a crack on the head  that makes no noise and is quite as certain and more genteel  here bill wrench the shutter open  hes game enough now ill engage  ive seen older hands of his age took the same way for a minute or two on a cold night  sikes invoking terrific imprecations upon fagins head for sending oliver on such an errand plied the crowbar vigorously but with little noise  after some delay and some assistance from toby the shutter to which he had referred swung open on its hinges  it was a little lattice window about five feet and a half above the ground at the back of the house  which belonged to a scullery or small brewingplace at the end of the passage  the aperture was so small that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more securely but it was large enough to admit a boy of olivers size nevertheless  a very brief exercise of mr sikes art sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice and it soon stood wide open also  now listen you young limb whispered sikes drawing a dark lantern from his pocket and throwing the glare full on olivers face im a going to put you through there  take this light go softly up the steps straight afore you and along the little hall to the street door unfasten it and let us in  theres a bolt at the top you wont be able to reach interposed toby stand upon one of the hall chairs  there are three there bill with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on em  which is the old ladys arms  keep quiet cant you replied sikes with a threatening look the roomdoor is open is it  wide replied toby after peeping in to satisfy himself the game of that is that they always leave it open with a catch so that the dog whos got a bed in here may walk up and down the passage when he feels wakeful  ha ha barney ticed him away tonight  so neat  although mr crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper and laughed without noise sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent and to get to work  toby complied by first producing his lantern and placing it on the ground then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall beneath the window and his hands upon his knees so as to make a step of his back this was no sooner done than sikes mounting upon him put oliver gently through the window with his feet first and without leaving hold of his collar planted him safely on the floor inside  take this lantern said sikes looking into the room  you see the stairs afore you  oliver more dead than alive gasped out yes  sikes pointing to the streetdoor with the pistolbarrel briefly advised him to take notice that he was within shot all the way and that if he faltered he would fall dead that instant  its done in a minute said sikes in the same low whisper directly i leave go of you do your work  hark  whats that whispered the other man  they listened intently  nothing said sikes releasing his hold of oliver  now  in the short time he had had to collect his senses the boy had firmly resolved that whether he died in the attempt or not he would make one effort to dart upstairs from the hall and alarm the family  filled with this idea he advanced at once but stealthily  come back suddenly cried sikes aloud  back back  scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place and by a loud cry which followed it oliver let his lantern fall and knew not whether to advance or fly  the cry was repeateda light appeareda vision of two terrified halfdressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyesa flasha loud noisea smokea crash somewhere but where he knew notand he staggered back  sikes had disappeared for an instant but he was up again and had him by the collar before the smoke had cleared away  he fired his own pistol after the men who were already retreating and dragged the boy up  clasp your arm tighter said sikes as he drew him through the window  give me a shawl here  theyve hit him  quick  how the boy bleeds  then came the loud ringing of a bell mingled with the noise of firearms and the shouts of men and the sensation of being carried over uneven ground at a rapid pace  and then the noises grew confused in the distance and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boys heart and he saw or heard no more
