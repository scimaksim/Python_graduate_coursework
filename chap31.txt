chapter xxix  has an introductory account of the inmates of the house to which oliver resorted  in a handsome room  though its furniture had rather the air of oldfashioned comfort than of modern elegance  there sat two ladies at a wellspread breakfasttable  mr giles dressed with scrupulous care in a full suit of black was in attendance upon them  he had taken his station some halfway between the sideboard and the breakfasttable and with his body drawn up to its full height his head thrown back and inclined the merest trifle on one side his left leg advanced and his right hand thrust into his waistcoat while his left hung down by his side grasping a waiter looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance  of the two ladies one was well advanced in years but the highbacked oaken chair in which she sat was not more upright than she  dressed with the utmost nicety and precision in a quaint mixture of bygone costume with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste which rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect she sat in a stately manner with her hands folded on the table before her  her eyes and age had dimmed but little of their brightness were attentively upon her young companion  the younger lady was in the lovely bloom and springtime of womanhood at that age when if ever angels be for gods good purposes enthroned in mortal forms they may be without impiety supposed to abide in such as hers  she was not past seventeen  cast in so slight and exquisite a mould so mild and gentle so pure and beautiful that earth seemed not her element nor its rough creatures her fit companions  the very intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye and was stamped upon her noble head seemed scarcely of her age or of the world and yet the changing expression of sweetness and good humour the thousand lights that played about the face and left no shadow there above all the smile the cheerful happy smile were made for home and fireside peace and happiness  she was busily engaged in the little offices of the table chancing to raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her she playfully put back her hair which was simply braided on her forehead and threw into her beaming look such an expression of affection and artless loveliness that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her  and brittles has been gone upwards of an hour has he asked the old lady after a pause  an hour and twelve minutes maam replied mr giles referring to a silver watch which he drew forth by a black ribbon  he is always slow remarked the old lady  brittles always was a slow boy maam replied the attendant and seeing by the bye that brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of thirty years there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast one  he gets worse instead of better i think said the elder lady  it is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys said the young lady smiling  mr giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a respectful smile himself when a gig drove up to the gardengate out of which there jumped a fat gentleman who ran straight up to the door and who getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process burst into the room and nearly overturned mr giles and the breakfasttable together  i never heard of such a thing exclaimed the fat gentleman my dear mrs mayliebless my soulin the silence of the night tooi never heard of such a thing  with these expressions of condolence the fat gentleman shook hands with both ladies and drawing up a chair inquired how they found themselves  you ought to be dead positively dead with the fright said the fat gentleman  why didnt you send  bless me my man should have come in a minute and so would i and my assistant would have been delighted or anybody im sure under such circumstances  dear dear  so unexpected  in the silence of the night too  the doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having been unexpected and attempted in the nighttime as if it were the established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact business at noon and to make an appointment by post a day or two previous  and you miss rose said the doctor turning to the young lady i  oh very much so indeed said rose interrupting him but there is a poor creature upstairs whom aunt wishes you to see  ah to be sure replied the doctor so there is  that was your handiwork giles i understand  mr giles who had been feverishly putting the teacups to rights blushed very red and said that he had had that honour  honour eh said the doctor well i dont know perhaps its as honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen as to hit your man at twelve paces  fancy that he fired in the air and youve fought a duel giles  mr giles who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust attempt at diminishing his glory answered respectfully that it was not for the like of him to judge about that but he rather thought it was no joke to the opposite party  gad thats true said the doctor  where is he  show me the way ill look in again as i come down mrs maylie  thats the little window that he got in at eh  well i couldnt have believed it  talking all the way he followed mr giles upstairs and while he is going upstairs the reader may be informed that mr losberne a surgeon in the neighbourhood known through a circuit of ten miles round as the doctor had grown fat more from goodhumour than from good living  and was as kind and hearty and withal as eccentric an old bachelor as will be found in five times that space by any explorer alive  the doctor was absent much longer than either he or the ladies had anticipated  a large flat box was fetched out of the gig and a bedroom bell was rung very often and the servants ran up and down stairs perpetually from which tokens it was justly concluded that something important was going on above  at length he returned and in reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient looked very mysterious and closed the door carefully  this is a very extraordinary thing mrs maylie said the doctor standing with his back to the door as if to keep it shut  he is not in danger i hope said the old lady  why that would not be an extraordinary thing under the circumstances replied the doctor though i dont think he is have you seen the thief  no rejoined the old lady  nor heard anything about him  no  i beg your pardon maam interposed mr giles but i was going to tell you about him when doctor losberne came in  the fact was that mr giles had not at first been able to bring his mind to the avowal that he had only shot a boy  such commendations had been bestowed upon his bravery that he could not for the life of him help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes during which he had flourished in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted courage  rose wished to see the man said mrs maylie but i wouldnt hear of it  humph rejoined the doctor  there is nothing very alarming in his appearance  have you any objection to see him in my presence  if it be necessary replied the old lady certainly not  then i think it is necessary said the doctor at all events i am quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so if you postponed it  he is perfectly quiet and comfortable now allow memiss rose will you permit me  not the slightest fear i pledge you my honour
