chapter xiv  comprising further particulars of olivers stay at mr brownlows with the remarkable prediction which one mr grimwig uttered concerning him when he went out on an errand  oliver soon recovering from the faintingfit into which mr brownlows abrupt exclamation had thrown him the subject of the picture was carefully avoided both by the old gentleman and mrs bedwin in the conversation that ensued  which indeed bore no reference to olivers history or prospects but was confined to such topics as might amuse without exciting him  he was still too weak to get up to breakfast but when he came down into the housekeepers room next day his first act was to cast an eager glance at the wall in the hope of again looking on the face of the beautiful lady  his expectations were disappointed however for the picture had been removed  ah said the housekeeper watching the direction of olivers eyes it is gone you see  i see it is maam replied oliver  why have they taken it away  it has been taken down child because mr brownlow said that as it seemed to worry you perhaps it might prevent your getting well you know rejoined the old lady  oh no indeed  it didnt worry me maam said oliver i liked to see it  i quite loved it  well well said the old lady goodhumouredly you get well as fast as ever you can dear and it shall be hung up again there  i promise you that  now let us talk about something else  this was all the information oliver could obtain about the picture at that time  as the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness he endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then so he listened attentively to a great many stories she told him about an amiable and handsome daughter of hers who was married to an amiable and handsome man and lived in the country and about a son who was clerk to a merchant in the west indies and who was also such a good young man and wrote such dutiful letters home four times ayear that it brought the tears into her eyes to talk about them  when the old lady had expatiated a long time on the excellences of her children and the merits of her kind good husband besides who had been dead and gone poor dear soul just sixandtwenty years it was time to have tea after tea she began to teach oliver cribbage which he learnt as quickly as she could teach  and at which game they played with great interest and gravity until it was time for the invalid to have some warm wine and water with a slice of dry toast and then to go cosily to bed  they were happy days those of olivers recovery  everything was so quiet and neat and orderly everybody so kind and gentle that after the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived it seemed like heaven itself  he was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on properly than mr brownlow caused a complete new suit and a new cap and a new pair of shoes to be provided for him  as oliver was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes he gave them to a servant who had been very kind to him and asked her to sell them to a jew and keep the money for herself  this she very readily did and as oliver looked out of the parlour window and saw the jew roll them up in his bag and walk away he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear them again  they were sad rags to tell the truth and oliver had never had a new suit before  one evening about a week after the affair of the picture as he was sitting talking to mrs bedwin there came a message down from mr brownlow that if oliver twist felt pretty well he should like to see him in his study and talk to him a little while  bless us and save us  wash your hands and let me part your hair nicely for you child said mrs bedwin  dear heart alive  if we had known he would have asked for you we would have put you a clean collar on and made you as smart as sixpence  oliver did as the old lady bade him and although she lamented grievously meanwhile that there was not even time to crimp the little frill that bordered his shirtcollar he looked so delicate and handsome despite that important personal advantage that she went so far as to say  looking at him with great complacency from head to foot that she really didnt think it would have been possible on the longest notice to have made much difference in him for the better  thus encouraged oliver tapped at the study door  on mr brownlow calling to him to come in he found himself in a little back room quite full of books with a window looking into some pleasant little gardens  there was a table drawn up before the window at which mr brownlow was seated reading  when he saw oliver he pushed the book away from him and told him to come near the table and sit down oliver complied marvelling where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world wiser  which is still a marvel to more experienced people than oliver twist every day of their lives  there are a good many books are there not my boy said mr brownlow observing the curiosity with which oliver surveyed the shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling  a great number sir replied oliver  i never saw so many  you shall read them if you behave well said the old gentleman kindly and you will like that better than looking at the outsidesthat is some cases because there are books of which the backs and covers are by far the best parts  i suppose they are those heavy ones sir said oliver pointing to some large quartos with a good deal of gilding about the binding  not always those said the old gentleman patting oliver on the head and smiling as he did so there are other equally heavy ones though of a much smaller size  how should you like to grow up a clever man and write books eh  i think i would rather read them sir replied oliver  what wouldnt you like to be a bookwriter said the old gentleman  oliver considered a little while and at last said he should think it would be a much better thing to be a bookseller upon which the old gentleman laughed heartily and declared he had said a very good thing which oliver felt glad to have done though he by no means knew what it was  well well said the old gentleman composing his features dont be afraid  we wont make an author of you while theres an honest trade to be learnt or brickmaking to turn to  thank you sir said oliver  at the earnest manner of his reply the old gentleman laughed again and said something about a curious instinct which oliver not understanding paid no very great attention to  now said mr brownlow speaking if possible in a kinder but at the same time in a much more serious manner than oliver had ever known him assume yet i want you to pay great attention my boy to what i am going to say  i shall talk to you without any reserve because i am sure you are well able to understand me as many older persons would be  oh dont tell you are going to send me away sir pray exclaimed oliver alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentlemans commencement  dont turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again  let me stay here and be a servant  dont send me back to the wretched place i came from  have mercy upon a poor boy sir  my dear child said the old gentleman moved by the warmth of olivers sudden appeal you need not be afraid of my deserting you unless you give me cause  i never never will sir interposed oliver  i hope not rejoined the old gentleman  i do not think you ever will  i have been deceived before in the objects whom i have endeavoured to benefit but i feel strongly disposed to trust you nevertheless and i am more interested in your behalf than i can well account for even to myself  the persons on whom i have bestowed my dearest love lie deep in their graves but although the happiness and delight of my life lie buried there too i have not made a coffin of my heart and sealed it up forever on my best affections  deep affliction has but strengthened and refined them  as the old gentleman said this in a low voice  more to himself than to his companion  and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards oliver sat quite still  well well said the old gentleman at length in a more cheerful tone i only say this because you have a young heart and knowing that i have suffered great pain and sorrow you will be more careful perhaps not to wound me again  you say you are an orphan without a friend in the world all the inquiries i have been able to make confirm the statement  let me hear your story where you come from who brought you up and how you got into the company in which i found you  speak the truth and you shall not be friendless while i live  olivers sobs checked his utterance for some minutes when he was on the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm and carried to the workhouse by mr bumble a peculiarly impatient little doubleknock was heard at the streetdoor  and the servant running upstairs announced mr grimwig  is he coming up inquired mr brownlow  yes sir replied the servant  he asked if there were any muffins in the house and when i told him yes he said he had come to tea  mr brownlow smiled and turning to oliver said that mr grimwig was an old friend of his and he must not mind his being a little rough in his manners for he was a worthy creature at bottom as he had reason to know  shall i go downstairs sir inquired oliver  no replied mr brownlow i would rather you remained here  at this moment there walked into the room  supporting himself by a thick stick  a stout old gentleman rather lame in one leg who was dressed in a blue coat striped waistcoat nankeen breeches and gaiters and a broadbrimmed white hat with the sides turned up with green  a very smallplaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat and a very long steel watchchain with nothing but a key at the end dangled loosely below it  the ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about the size of an orange the variety of shapes into which his countenance was twisted defy description  he had a manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke and of looking out of the corners of his eyes at the same time  which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot  in this attitude he fixed himself the moment he made his appearance and holding out a small piece of orangepeel at arms length exclaimed in a growling discontented voice  look here do you see this  isnt it a most wonderful and extraordinary thing that i cant call at a mans house but i find a piece of this poor surgeons friend on the staircase ive been lamed with orangepeel once and i know orangepeel will be my death or ill be content to eat my own head sir  this was the handsome offer with which mr grimwig backed and confirmed nearly every assertion he made and it was the more singular in his case because even admitting for the sake of argument the possibility of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed mr grimwigs head was such a particularly large one that the most sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at a sittingto put entirely out of the question a very thick coating of powder  ill eat my head sir repeated mr grimwig striking his stick upon the ground  hallo whats that looking at oliver and retreating a pace or two  this is young oliver twist whom we were speaking about said mr brownlow  oliver bowed  you dont mean to say thats the boy who had the fever i hope said mr grimwig recoiling a little more  wait a minute dont speak stop continued mr grimwig abruptly losing all dread of the fever in his triumph at the discovery thats the boy who had the orange if thats not the boy sir who had the orange and threw this bit of peel upon the staircase ill eat my head and his too  no no he has not had one said mr brownlow laughing come  put down your hat and speak to my young friend  i feel strongly on this subject sir said the irritable old gentleman drawing off his gloves  theres always more or less orangepeel on the pavement in our street and i know its put there by the surgeons boy at the corner  a young woman stumbled over a bit last night and fell against my gardenrailings directly she got up i saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomimelight dont go to him i called out of the window hes an assassin  a mantrap  so he is  if he is not  here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick which was always understood by his friends to imply the customary offer whenever it was not expressed in words then still keeping his stick in his hand he sat down and opening a double eyeglass which he wore attached to a broad black riband took a view of oliver  who seeing that he was the object of inspection coloured and bowed again  thats the boy is it said mr grimwig at length  thats the boy replied mr brownlow  how are you boy said mr grimwig  a great deal better thank you sir replied oliver  mr brownlow seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to say something disagreeable asked oliver to step downstairs and tell mrs bedwin they were ready for tea which as he did not half like the visitors manner he was very happy to do  he is a nicelooking boy is he not inquired mr brownlow  i dont know replied mr grimwig pettishly  dont know  no  i dont know  i never see any difference in boys  i only knew two sort of boys  mealy boys and beeffaced boys  and which is oliver  mealy  i know a friend who has a beeffaced boy a fine boy they call him with a round head and red cheeks and glaring eyes a horrid boy with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his blue clothes with the voice of a pilot and the appetite of a wolf  i know him  the wretch  come said mr brownlow these are not the characteristics of young oliver twist so he neednt excite your wrath  they are not replied mr grimwig  he may have worse  here mr brownlow coughed impatiently which appeared to afford mr grimwig the most exquisite delight  he may have worse i say repeated mr grimwig  where does he come from  who is he  what is he  he has had a fever  what of that fevers are not peculiar to good people are they  bad people have fevers sometimes havent they eh  i knew a man who was hung in jamaica for murdering his master  he had had a fever six times he wasnt recommended to mercy on that account  pooh nonsense  now the fact was that in the inmost recesses of his own heart mr grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that olivers appearance and manner were unusually prepossessing but he had a strong appetite for contradiction sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the orangepeel and inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him whether a boy was welllooking or not he had resolved from the first to oppose his friend  when mr brownlow admitted that on no one point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer and that he had postponed any investigation into olivers previous history until he thought the boy was strong enough to hear it mr grimwig chuckled maliciously  and he demanded with a sneer whether the housekeeper was in the habit of counting the plate at night because if she didnt find a tablespoon or two missing some sunshiny morning why he would be content toand so forth  all this mr brownlow although himself somewhat of an impetuous gentleman  knowing his friends peculiarities bore with great good humour as mr grimwig at tea was graciously pleased to express his entire approval of the muffins matters went on very smoothly and oliver who made one of the party began to feel more at his ease than he had yet done in the fierce old gentlemans presence  and when are you going to hear a full true and particular account of the life and adventures of oliver twist asked grimwig of mr brownlow at the conclusion of the meal looking sideways at oliver as he resumed his subject  tomorrow morning replied mr brownlow  i would rather he was alone with me at the time  come up to me tomorrow morning at ten oclock my dear  yes sir replied oliver  he answered with some hesitation because he was confused by mr grimwigs looking so hard at him  ill tell you what whispered that gentleman to mr brownlow he wont come up to you tomorrow morning  i saw him hesitate he is deceiving you my good friend  ill swear he is not replied mr brownlow warmly  if he is not said mr grimwig ill and down went the stick  ill answer for that boys truth with my life said mr brownlow knocking the table  and i for his falsehood with my head rejoined mr grimwig knocking the table also  we shall see said mr brownlow checking his rising anger  we will replied mr grimwig with a provoking smile  we will  as fate would have it mrs bedwin chanced to bring in at this moment a small parcel of books which mr brownlow had that morning purchased of the identical bookstallkeeper who has already figured in this history having laid them on the table she prepared to leave the room  stop the boy mrs bedwin said mr brownlow there is something to go back  he has gone sir replied mrs bedwin  call after him said mr brownlow its particular  he is a poor man and they are not paid for  there are some books to be taken back too  the streetdoor was opened  oliver ran one way and the girl ran another and mrs bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy but there was no boy in sight  oliver and the girl returned in a breathless state to report that there were no tidings of him  dear me i am very sorry for that exclaimed mr brownlow i particularly wished those books to be returned tonight  send oliver with them said mr grimwig with an ironical smile he will be sure to deliver them safely you know  yes do let me take them if you please sir said oliver ill run all the way sir  the old gentleman was just going to say that oliver should not go out on any account when a most malicious cough from mr grimwig determined him that he should and that by his prompt discharge of the commission he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions  on this head at least  at once  you shall go my dear said the old gentleman  the books are on a chair by my table  fetch them down  oliver delighted to be of use brought down the books under his arm in a great bustle and waited cap in hand to hear what message he was to take  you are to say said mr brownlow glancing steadily at grimwig you are to say that you have brought those books back and that you have come to pay the four pound ten i owe him  this is a fivepound note so you will have to bring me back ten shillings change  i wont be ten minutes sir said oliver eagerly  having buttoned up the banknote in his jacket pocket and placed the books carefully under his arm he made a respectful bow and left the room  mrs bedwin followed him to the streetdoor giving him many directions about the nearest way and the name of the bookseller and the name of the street  all of which oliver said he clearly understood  having superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold the old lady at length permitted him to depart  bless his sweet face said the old lady looking after him i cant bear somehow to let him go out of my sight  at this moment oliver looked gaily round and nodded before he turned the corner  the old lady smilingly returned his salutation and closing the door went back to her own room  let me see hell be back in twenty minutes at the longest said mr brownlow pulling out his watch and placing it on the table  it will be dark by that time  oh you really expect him to come back do you inquired mr grimwig  dont you asked mr brownlow smiling  the spirit of contradiction was strong in mr grimwigs breast at the moment and it was rendered stronger by his friends confident smile  no he said smiting the table with his fist i do not the boy has a new suit of clothes on his back a set of valuable books under his arm and a fivepound note in his pocket  hell join his old friends the thieves and laugh at you  if ever that boy returns to this house sir ill eat my head  with these words he drew his chair closer to the table and there the two friends sat in silent expectation with the watch between them  it is worthy of remark as illustrating the importance we attach to our own judgments and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and hasty conclusions that although mr grimwig was not by any means a badhearted man and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see his respected friend duped and deceived he really did most earnestly and strongly hope at that moment that oliver twist might not come back  it grew so dark that the figures on the dialplate were scarcely discernible but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit in silence with the watch between them
