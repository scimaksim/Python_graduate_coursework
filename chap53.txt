chapter li  affording an explanation of more mysteries than one and comprehending a proposal of marriage with no word of settlement or pinmoney  the events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old when oliver found himself at three oclock in the afternoon in a travellingcarriage rolling fast towards his native town  mrs maylie and rose and mrs bedwin and the good doctor were with him  and mr brownlow followed in a postchaise accompanied by one other person whose name had not been mentioned  they had not talked much upon the way for oliver was in a flutter of agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting his thoughts and almost of speech and appeared to have scarcely less effect on his companions who shared it in at least an equal degree he and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by mr brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from monks and although they knew that the object of their present journey was to complete the work which had been so well begun still the whole matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the most intense suspense  the same kind friend had with mr losbernes assistance cautiously stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place it was quite true he said that they must know them before long but it might be at a better time than the present and it could not be at a worse  so they travelled on in silence  each busied with reflections on the object which had brought them together  and no one disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all  but if oliver under these influences had remained silent while they journeyed towards his birthplace by a road he had never seen how the whole current of his recollections ran back to old times and what a crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast when they turned into that which he had traversed on foot  a poor houseless wandering boy without a friend to help him or a roof to shelter his head  see there there cried oliver eagerly clasping the hand of rose and pointing out at the carriage window thats the stile i came over there are the hedges i crept behind for fear any one should overtake me and force me back  yonder is the path across the fields leading to the old house where i was a little child  oh dick dick my dear old friend if i could only see you now  you will see him soon replied rose gently taking his folded hands between her own  you shall tell him how happy you are and how rich you have grown and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the coming back to make him happy too  yes yes said oliver and wellwell take him away from here and have him clothed and taught and send him to some quiet country place where he may grow strong and wellshall we  rose nodded yes for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that she could not speak  you will be kind and good to him for you are to every one said oliver  it will make you cry i know to hear what he can tell but never mind never mind it will be all over and you will smile againi know that tooto think how changed he is you did the same with me  he said god bless you to me when i ran away cried the boy with a burst of affectionate emotion and i will say god bless you now and show him how i love him for it  as they approached the town and at length drove through its narrow streets it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy within reasonable bounds  there was sowerberrys the undertakers just as it used to be only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he remembered itthere were all the wellknown shops and houses with almost every one of which he had some slight incident connectedthere was gamfields cart the very cart he used to have standing at the old publichouse doorthere was the workhouse the dreary prison of his youthful days with its dismal windows frowning on the streetthere was the same lean porter standing at the gate at sight of whom oliver involuntarily shrunk back and then laughed at himself for being so foolish then cried then laughed againthere were scores of faces at the doors and windows that he knew quite wellthere was nearly everything as if he had left it but yesterday and all his recent life had been but a happy dream  but it was pure earnest joyful reality  they drove straight to the door of the chief hotel which oliver used to stare up at with awe and think a mighty palace but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size and here was mr grimwig all ready to receive them kissing the young lady and the old one too when they got out of the coach as if he were the grandfather of the whole party all smiles and kindness and not offering to eat his headno not once not even when he contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to london and maintained he knew it best though he had only come that way once and that time fast asleep  there was dinner prepared and there were bedrooms ready and everything was arranged as if by magic  notwithstanding all this when the hurry of the first halfhour was over the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey down  mr brownlow did not join them at dinner but remained in a separate room  the two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces and during the short intervals when they were present conversed apart  once mrs maylie was called away and after being absent for nearly an hour returned with eyes swollen with weeping all these things made rose and oliver who were not in any new secrets nervous and uncomfortable  they sat wondering in silence or if they exchanged a few words spoke in whispers as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices  at length when nine oclock had come and they began to think they were to hear no more that night mr losberne and mr grimwig entered the room followed by mr brownlow and a man whom oliver almost shrieked with surprise to see for they told him it was his brother and it was the same man he had met at the markettown and seen looking in with fagin at the window of his little room  monks cast a look of hate which even then he could not dissemble at the astonished boy and sat down near the door  mr brownlow who had papers in his hand walked to a table near which rose and oliver were seated  this is a painful task said he but these declarations which have been signed in london before many gentlemen must be in substance repeated here  i would have spared you the degradation but we must hear them from your own lips before we part and you know why  go on said the person addressed turning away his face quick  i have almost done enough i think  dont keep me here  this child said mr brownlow drawing oliver to him and laying his hand upon his head is your halfbrother the illegitimate son of your father my dear friend edwin leeford by poor young agnes fleming who died in giving him birth  yes said monks scowling at the trembling boy  the beating of whose heart he might have heard  that is the bastard child  the term you use said mr brownlow sternly is a reproach to those long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world it reflects disgrace on no one living except you who use it let that pass  he was born in this town  in the workhouse of this town was the sullen reply you have the story there  he pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke  i must have it here too said mr brownlow looking round upon the listeners  listen then  you returned monks  his father being taken ill at rome was joined by his wife my mother from whom he had been long separated who went from paris and took me with herto look after his property for what i know for she had no great affection for him nor he for her  he knew nothing of us for his senses were gone and he slumbered on till next day when he died  among the papers in his desk were two dated on the night his illness first came on directed to yourself he addressed himself to mr brownlow and enclosed in a few short lines to you with an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead  one of these papers was a letter to this girl agnes the other a will  what of the letter asked mr brownlow  the lettera sheet of paper crossed and crossed again with a penitent confession and prayers to god to help her  he had palmed a tale on the girl that some secret mysteryto be explained one dayprevented his marrying her just then and so she had gone on trusting patiently to him until she trusted too far and lost what none could ever give her back  she was at that time within a few months of her confinement  he told her all he had meant to do to hide her shame if he had lived and prayed her if he died not to curse his memory or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on her or their young child for all the guilt was his  he reminded her of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it and a blank left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon herprayed her yet to keep it and wear it next her heart as she had done beforeand then ran on wildly in the same words over and over again as if he had gone distracted  i believe he had  the will said mr brownlow as olivers tears fell fast  monks was silent  the will said mr brownlow speaking for him was in the same spirit as the letter  he talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him of the rebellious disposition vice malice and premature bad passions of you his only son who had been trained to hate him and left you and your mother each an annuity of eight hundred pounds the bulk of his property he divided into two equal portionsone for agnes fleming and the other for their child if it should be born alive and ever come of age  if it were a girl it was to inherit the money unconditionally but if a boy only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act of dishonour meanness cowardice or wrong  he did this he said to mark his confidence in the other and his convictiononly strengthened by approaching deaththat the child would share her gentle heart and noble nature  if he were disappointed in this expectation then the money was to come to you  for then and not till then when both children were equal would he recognise your prior claim upon his purse who had none upon his heart but had from an infant repulsed him with coldness and aversion  my mother said monks in a louder tone did what a woman should have done  she burnt this will  the letter never reached its destination but that and other proofs she kept in case they ever tried to lie away the blot  the girls father had the truth from her with every aggravation that her violent hatei love her for it nowcould add  goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of wales changing his very name that his friends might never know of his retreat and here no great while afterwards he was found dead in his bed  the girl had left her home in secret some weeks before he had searched for her on foot in every town and village near it was on the night when he returned home assured that she had destroyed herself to hide her shame and his that his old heart broke  there was a short silence here until mr brownlow took up the thread of the narrative  years after this he said this mansedward leefordsmother came to me  he had left her when only eighteen robbed her of jewels and money gambled squandered forged and fled to london  where for two years he had associated with the lowest outcasts  she was sinking under a painful and incurable disease and wished to recover him before she died  inquiries were set on foot and strict searches made they were unavailing for a long time but ultimately successful and he went back with her to france  there she died said monks after a lingering illness and on her deathbed she bequeathed these secrets to me together with her unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involvedthough she need not have left me that for i had inherited it long before  she would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself and the child too but was filled with the impression that a male child had been born and was alive  i swore to her if ever it crossed my path to hunt it down never to let it rest to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting animosity to vent upon it the hatred that i deeply felt and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by draggin it if i could to the very gallowsfoot  she was right he came in my way at last  i began well and but for babbling drabs i would have finished as i began  as the villain folded his arms tight together and muttered curses on himself in the impotence of baffled malice mr brownlow turned to the terrified group beside him and explained that the jew who had been his old accomplice and confidant had a large reward for keeping oliver ensnared  of which some part was to be given up in the event of his being rescued  and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the country house for the purpose of identifying him  the locket and ring said mr brownlow turning to monks  i bought them from the man and woman i told you of who stole them from the nurse who stole them from the corpse answered monks without raising his eyes  you know what became of them  mr brownlow merely nodded to mr grimwig who disappearing with great alacrity shortly returned pushing in mrs bumble and dragging her unwilling consort after him  do my his deceive me cried mr bumble with illfeigned enthusiasm or is that little oliver  oh oliver if you knowd how ive been agrieving for you  hold your tongue fool murmured mrs bumble  isnt natur natur mrs bumble remonstrated the workhouse master cant i be supposed to feeli as brought him up porochiallywhen i see him asetting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest description  i always loved that boy as if hed been mymymy own grandfather said mr bumble halting for an appropriate comparison master oliver my dear you remember the blessed gentleman in the white waistcoat  ah he went to heaven last week in a oak coffin with plated handles oliver  come sir said mr grimwig tartly suppress your feelings  i will do my endeavours sir replied mr bumble  how do you do sir  i hope you are very well  this salutation was addressed to mr brownlow who had stepped up to within a short distance of the respectable couple  he inquired as he pointed to monks  do you know that person  no replied mrs bumble flatly  perhaps you dont said mr brownlow addressing her spouse  i never saw him in all my life said mr bumble  nor sold him anything perhaps  no replied mrs bumble  you never had perhaps a certain gold locket and ring said mr brownlow  certainly not replied the matron  why are we brought here to answer to such nonsense as this  again mr brownlow nodded to mr grimwig and again that gentleman limped away with extraordinary readiness  but not again did he return with a stout man and wife for this time he led in two palsied women who shook and tottered as they walked  you shut the door the night old sally died said the foremost one raising her shrivelled hand but you couldnt shut out the sound nor stop the chinks  no no said the other looking round her and wagging her toothless jaws  no no no  we heard her try to tell you what shed done and saw you take a paper from her hand and watched you too next day to the pawnbrokers shop said the first  yes added the second and it was a locket and gold ring we found out that and saw it given you  we were by  oh we were by  and we know more than that resumed the first for she told us often long ago that the young mother had told her that feeling she should never get over it she was on her way at the time that she was taken ill to die near the grave of the father of the child  would you like to see the pawnbroker himself asked mr grimwig with a motion towards the door  no replied the woman if heshe pointed to monkshas been coward enough to confess as i see he has and you have sounded all these hags till you have found the right ones i have nothing more to say  i did sell them and theyre where youll never get them  what then  nothing replied mr brownlow except that it remains for us to take care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again you may leave the room  i hope said mr bumble looking about him with great ruefulness as mr grimwig disappeared with the two old women i hope that this unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office  indeed it will replied mr brownlow  you may make up your mind to that and think yourself well off besides  it was all mrs bumble  she would do it urged mr bumble first looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room  that is no excuse replied mr brownlow  you were present on the occasion of the destruction of these trinkets and indeed are the more guilty of the two in the eye of the law for the law supposes that your wife acts under your direction  if the law supposes that said mr bumble squeezing his hat emphatically in both hands the law is a assa idiot  if thats the eye of the law the law is a bachelor and the worst i wish the law is that his eye may be opened by experienceby experience  laying great stress on the repetition of these two words mr bumble fixed his hat on very tight and putting his hands in his pockets followed his helpmate downstairs  young lady said mr brownlow turning to rose give me your hand do not tremble  you need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to say  if they havei do not know how they can but if they haveany reference to me said rose pray let me hear them at some other time i have not strength or spirits now  nay returned the old gentlman drawing her arm through his you have more fortitude than this i am sure  do you know this young lady sir  yes replied monks  i never saw you before said rose faintly  i have seen you often returned monks  the father of the unhappy agnes had two daughters said mr brownlow  what was the fate of the otherthe child  the child replied monks when her father died in a strange place in a strange name without a letter book or scrap of paper that yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be tracedthe child was taken by some wretched cottagers who reared it as their own  go on said mr brownlow signing to mrs maylie to approach go on  you couldnt find the spot to which these people had repaired said monks but where friendship fails hatred will often force a way  my mother found it after a year of cunning searchay and found the child  she took it did she  no  the people were poor and began to sickenat least the man didof their fine humanity so she left it with them giving them a small present of money which would not last long and promised more which she never meant to send  she didnt quite rely however on their discontent and poverty for the childs unhappiness but told the history of the sisters shame with such alterations as suited her bade them take good heed of the child for she came of bad blood and told them she was illegitimate and sure to go wrong at one time or other  the circumstances countenanced all this the people believed it and there the child dragged on an existence miserable enough even to satisfy us until a widow lady residing then at chester saw the girl by chance pitied her and took her home  there was some cursed spell i think against us for in spite of all our efforts she remained there and was happy  i lost sight of her two or three years ago and saw her no more until a few months back  do you see her now  yes  leaning on your arm  but not the less my niece cried mrs maylie folding the fainting girl in her arms not the less my dearest child  i would not lose her now for all the treasures of the world  my sweet companion my own dear girl  the only friend i ever had cried rose clinging to her the kindest best of friends  my heart will burst  i cannot bear all this  you have borne more and have been through all the best and gentlest creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew said mrs maylie embracing her tenderly come come my love remember who this is who waits to clasp you in his arms poor child  see herelook look my dear  not aunt cried oliver throwing his arms about her neck ill never call her auntsister my own dear sister that something taught my heart to love so dearly from the first  rose dear darling rose  let the tears which fell and the broken words which were exchanged in the long close embrace between the orphans be sacred  a father sister and mother were gained and lost in that one moment  joy and grief were mingled in the cup but there were no bitter tears  for even grief itself arose so softened and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections that it became a solemn pleasure and lost all character of pain  they were a long long time alone  a soft tap at the door at length announced that some one was without  oliver opened it glided away and gave place to harry maylie  i know it all he said taking a seat beside the lovely girl dear rose i know it all  i am not here by accident he added after a lengthened silence nor have i heard all this tonight for i knew it yesterdayonly yesterday  do you guess that i have come to remind you of a promise  stay said rose  you do know all  all  you gave me leave at any time within a year to renew the subject of our last discourse  i did  not to press you to alter your determination pursued the young man but to hear you repeat it if you would i was to lay whatever of station or fortune i might possess at your feet and if you still adhered to your former determination i pledged myself by no word or act to seek to change it  the same reasons which influenced me then will influence me now said rose firmly  if i ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering when should i ever feel it as i should tonight  it is a struggle said rose but one i am proud to make it is a pang but one my heart shall bear  the disclosure of tonightharry began  the disclosure of tonight replied rose softly leaves me in the same position with reference to you as that in which i stood before  you harden your heart against me rose urged her lover  oh harry harry said the young lady bursting into tears i wish i could and spare myself this pain  then why inflict it on yourself said harry taking her hand think dear rose think what you have heard tonight  and what have i heard  what have i heard cried rose that a sense of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned allthere we have said enough harry we have said enough  not yet not yet said the young man detaining her as she rose  my hopes my wishes prospects feeling  every thought in life except my love for you  have undergone a change  i offer you now no distinction among a bustling crowd no mingling with a world of malice and detraction where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and shame but a homea heart and homeyes dearest rose and those and those alone are all i have to offer  what do you mean she faltered  i mean but thisthat when i left you last i left you with a firm determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me resolved that if my world could not be yours i would make yours mine that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you for i would turn from it  this i have done  those who have shrunk from me because of this have shrunk from you and proved you so far right  such power and patronage  such relatives of influence and rank  as smiled upon me then look coldly now but there are smiling fields and waving trees in englands richest county and by one village churchmine rose my ownthere stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of than all the hopes i have renounced measured a thousandfold  this is my rank and station now and here i lay it down                                  its a trying thing waiting supper for lovers said mr grimwig waking up and pulling his pockethandkerchief from over his head  truth to tell the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time neither mrs maylie nor harry nor rose who all came in together could offer a word in extenuation  i had serious thoughts of eating my head tonight said mr grimwig for i began to think i should get nothing else  ill take the liberty if youll allow me of saluting the bride that is to be  mr grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the blushing girl and the example being contagious was followed both by the doctor and mr brownlow  some people affirm that harry maylie had been observed to set it originally in a dark room adjoining but the best authorities consider this downright scandal  he being young and a clergyman  oliver my child said mrs maylie where have you been and why do you look so sad  there are tears stealing down your face at this moment  what is the matter  it is a world of disappointment  often to the hopes we most cherish and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour  poor dick was dead
