chapter i  treats of the place where oliver twist was born and of the circumstances attending his birth  among other public buildings in a certain town which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning and to which i will assign no fictitious name there is one anciently common to most towns great or small to wit a workhouse and in this workhouse was born on a day and date which i need not trouble myself to repeat inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader in this stage of the business at all events the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter  for a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble by the parish surgeon it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared or if they had that being comprised within a couple of pages they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography extant in the literature of any age or country  although i am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being i do mean to say that in this particular instance it was the best thing for oliver twist that could by possibility have occurred  the fact is that there was considerable difficulty in inducing oliver to take upon himself the office of respirationa troublesome practice but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress rather unequally poised between this world and the next the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter  now if during this brief period oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers anxious aunts experienced nurses and doctors of profound wisdom he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time  there being nobody by however but a pauper old woman who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract oliver and nature fought out the point between them  the result was that after a few struggles oliver breathed sneezed and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed  upon the parish by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage a voice for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter  as oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead rustled the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words let me see the child and die  the surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately  as the young woman spoke he rose and advancing to the beds head said with more kindness than might have been expected of him  oh you must not talk about dying yet  lor bless her dear heart no interposed the nurse hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction  lor bless her dear heart when she has lived as long as i have sir and had thirteen children of her own and all on em dead except two and them in the wurkus with me shell know better than to take on in that way bless her dear heart  think what it is to be a mother theres a dear young lamb do  apparently this consolatory perspective of a mothers prospects failed in producing its due effect  the patient shook her head and stretched out her hand towards the child  the surgeon deposited it in her arms  she imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead passed her hands over her face gazed wildly round shuddered fell backand died they chafed her breast hands and temples but the blood had stopped forever  they talked of hope and comfort they had been strangers too long  its all over mrs thingummy said the surgeon at last  ah poor dear so it is said the nurse picking up the cork of the green bottle which had fallen out on the pillow as she stooped to take up the child  poor dear  you neednt mind sending up to me if the child cries nurse said the surgeon putting on his gloves with great deliberation its very likely it will be troublesome give it a little gruel if it is  he put on his hat and pausing by the bedside on his way to the door added she was a goodlooking girl too where did she come from  she was brought here last night replied the old woman by the overseers order  she was found lying in the street  she had walked some distance for her shoes were worn to pieces but where she came from or where she was going to nobody knows  the surgeon leaned over the body and raised the left hand  the old story he said shaking his head no weddingring i see ah goodnight  the medical gentleman walked away to dinner and the nurse having once more applied herself to the green bottle sat down on a low chair before the fire and proceeded to dress the infant  what an excellent example of the power of dress young oliver twist was  wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society  but now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service he was badged and ticketed and fell into his place at oncea parish childthe orphan of a workhousethe humble halfstarved drudgeto be cuffed and buffeted through the worlddespised by all and pitied by none  oliver cried lustily if he could have known that he was an orphan left to the tender mercies of churchwardens and overseers perhaps he would have cried the louder
