chapter l  the pursuit and escape  near to that part of the thames on which the church at rotherhithe abuts where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of closebuilt lowroofed houses there exists the filthiest the strangest the most extraordinary of the many localities that are hidden in london wholly unknown even by name to the great mass of its inhabitants  to reach this place the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close narrow and muddy streets thronged by the roughest and poorest of waterside people and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to occasion  the cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the shops the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at the salesmans door and stream from the houseparapet and windows jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class ballastheavers coalwhippers brazen women ragged children and the raff and refuse of the river he makes his way with difficulty along assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and left and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner  arriving at length in streets remoter and lessfrequented than those through which he has passed he walks beneath tottering housefronts projecting over the pavement dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall windows guarded by rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away every imaginable sign of desolation and neglect  in such a neighborhood beyond dockhead in the borough of southwark stands jacobs island surrounded by a muddy ditch six or eight feet deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in once called mill pond but known in the days of this story as folly ditch  it is a creek or inlet from the thames and can always be filled at high water by opening the sluices at the lead mills from which it took its old name  at such times a stranger looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at mill lane will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows buckets pails domestic utensils of all kinds in which to haul the water up and when his eye is turned from these operations to the houses themselves his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene before him  crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen houses with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath windows broken and patched with poles thrust out on which to dry the linen that is never there rooms so small so filthy so confined that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they shelter wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud and threatening to fall into itas some have done dirtbesmeared walls and decaying foundations every repulsive lineament of poverty every loathsome indication of filth rot and garbage all these ornament the banks of folly ditch  in jacobs island the warehouses are roofless and empty the walls are crumbling down the windows are windows no more the doors are falling into the streets the chimneys are blackened but they yield no smoke thirty or forty years ago before losses and chancery suits came upon it it was a thriving place but now it is a desolate island indeed the houses have no owners they are broken open and entered upon by those who have the courage and there they live and there they die they must have powerful motives for a secret residence or be reduced to a destitute condition indeed who seek a refuge in jacobs island  in an upper room of one of these housesa detached house of fair size ruinous in other respects but strongly defended at door and window of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already describedthere were assembled three men who regarding each other every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence  one of these was toby crackit another mr chitling and the third a robber of fifty years whose nose had been almost beaten in in some old scuffle and whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion  this man was a returned transport and his name was kags  i wish said toby turning to mr chitling that you had picked out some other crib when the two old ones got too warm and had not come here my fine feller  why didnt you blunderhead said kags  well i thought youd have been a little more glad to see me than this replied mr chitling with a melancholy air  why looke young gentleman said toby when a man keeps himself so very exclusive as i have done and by that means has a snug house over his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it its rather a startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at conweniency circumstanced as you are  especially when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with him thats arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts and is too modest to want to be presented to the judges on his return added mr kags  there was a short silence after which toby crackit seeming to abandon as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devilmaycare swagger turned to chitling and said  when was fagin took then  just at dinnertimetwo oclock this afternoon  charley and i made our lucky up the washus chimney and bolter got into the empty waterbutt head downwards but his legs were so precious long that they stuck out at the top and so they took him too  and bet  poor bet  she went to see the body to speak to who it was replied chitling his countenance falling more and more and went off mad screaming and raving and beating her head against the boards so they put a straitweskut on her and took her to the hospitaland there she is  wots come of young bates demanded kags  he hung about not to come over here afore dark but hell be here soon replied chitling  theres nowhere else to go to now for the people at the cripples are all in custody and the bar of the keni went up there and see it with my own eyesis filled with traps  this is a smash observed toby biting his lips theres more than one will go with this  the sessions are on said kags  if they get the inquest over and bolter turns kings evidence  as of course he will from what hes said already  they can prove fagin an accessory before the fact and get the trial on on friday and hell swing in six days from this by g  you should have heard the people groan said chitling the officers fought like devils or theyd have torn him away  he was down once but they made a ring round him and fought their way along  you should have seen how he looked about him all muddy and bleeding and clung to them as if they were his dearest friends  i can see em now not able to stand upright with the pressing of the mob and draggin him along amongst em i can see the people jumping up one behind another and snarling with their teeth and making at him i can see the blood upon his hair and beard and hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner and swore theyd tear his heart out  the horrorstricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro like one distracted  while he was thus engaged and the two men sat by in silence with their eyes fixed upon the floor a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs and sikess dog bounded into the room  they ran to the window downstairs and into the street  the dog had jumped in at an open window he made no attempt to follow them nor was his master to be seen  whats the meaning of this said toby when they had returned he cant be coming here  iihope not  if he was coming here hed have come with the dog said kags stooping down to examine the animal who lay panting on the floor here  give us some water for him he has run himself faint  hes drunk it all up every drop said chitling after watching the dog some time in silence  covered with mudlamehalf blindhe must have come a long way  where can he have come from exclaimed toby  hes been to the other kens of course and finding them filled with strangers come on here where hes been many a time and often  but where can he have come from first and how comes he here alone without the other  henone of them called the murderer by his old namehe cant have made away with himself  what do you think said chitling  toby shook his head  if he had said kags the dog ud want to lead us away to where he did it  no  i think hes got out of the country and left the dog behind  he must have given him the slip somehow or he wouldnt be so easy  this solution appearing the most probable one was adopted as the right the dog creeping under a chair coiled himself up to sleep without more notice from anybody  it being now dark the shutter was closed and a candle lighted and placed upon the table  the terrible events of the last two days had made a deep impression on all three increased by the danger and uncertainty of their own position  they drew their chairs closer together starting at every sound  they spoke little and that in whispers and were as silent and awestricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room  they had sat thus some time when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking at the door below  young bates said kags looking angrily round to check the fear he felt himself  the knocking came again  no it wasnt he  he never knocked like that  crackit went to the window and shaking all over drew in his head there was no need to tell them who it was his pale face was enough the dog too was on the alert in an instant and ran whining to the door  we must let him in he said taking up the candle  isnt there any help for it asked the other man in a hoarse voice  none  he must come in  dont leave us in the dark said kags taking down a candle from the chimneypiece and lighting it with such a trembling hand that the knocking was twice repeated before he had finished  crackit went down to the door and returned followed by a man with the lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief and another tied over his head under his hat  he drew them slowly off  blanched face sunken eyes hollow cheeks beard of three days growth wasted flesh short thick breath it was the very ghost of sikes  he laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room but shuddering as he was about to drop into it and seeming to glance over his shoulder dragged it back close to the wallas close as it would goand ground it against itand sat down  not a word had been exchanged  he looked from one to another in silence  if an eye were furtively raised and met his it was instantly averted  when his hollow voice broke silence they all three started they seemed never to have heard its tones before  how came that dog here he asked  alone  three hours ago  tonights paper says that fagins took  is it true or a lie  true  they were silent again  damn you all said sikes passing his hand across his forehead  have you nothing to say to me  there was an uneasy movement among them but nobody spoke  you that keep this house said sikes turning his face to crackit do you mean to sell me or to let me lie here till this hunt is over  you may stop here if you think it safe returned the person addressed after some hesitation  sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him  rather trying to turn his head than actually doing it  and said isitthe bodyis it buried  they shook their heads  why isnt it he retorted with the same glance behind him wot do they keep such ugly things above the ground forwhos that knocking  crackit intimated by a motion of his hand as he left the room that there was nothing to fear and directly came back with charley bates behind him  sikes sat opposite the door so that the moment the boy entered the room he encountered his figure  toby said the boy falling back as sikes turned his eyes towards him why didnt you tell me this downstairs  there had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad accordingly he nodded and made as though he would shake hands with him  let me go into some other room said the boy retreating still farther  charley said sikes stepping forward  dont youdont you know me  dont come nearer me answered the boy still retreating and looking with horror in his eyes upon the murderers face  you monster  the man stopped halfway and they looked at each other but sikess eyes sunk gradually to the ground  witness you three cried the boy shaking his clenched fist and becoming more and more excited as he spoke witness you threeim not afraid of himif they come here after him ill give him up i will i tell you out at once  he may kill me for it if he likes or if he dares but if i am here ill give him up  id give him up if he was to be boiled alive  murder help  if theres the pluck of a man among you three youll help me  murder  help  down with him  pouring out these cries and accompanying them with violent gesticulation the boy actually threw himself singlehanded upon the strong man and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise brought him heavily to the ground  the three spectators seemed quite stupefied  they offered no interference and the boy and man rolled on the ground together the former heedless of the blows that showered upon him wrenching his hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderers breast and never ceasing to call for help with all his might  the contest however was too unequal to last long  sikes had him down and his knee was on his throat when crackit pulled him back with a look of alarm and pointed to the window  there were lights gleaming below voices in loud and earnest conversation the tramp of hurried footstepsendless they seemed in numbercrossing the nearest wooden bridge  one man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd for there was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement  the gleam of lights increased the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on then came a loud knocking at the door and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail  help shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air  hes here  break down the door  in the kings name cried the voices without and the hoarse cry arose again but louder  break down the door screamed the boy  i tell you theyll never open it  run straight to the room where the light is break down the door  strokes thick and heavy rattled upon the door and lower windowshutters as he ceased to speak and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd giving the listener for the first time some adequate idea of its immense extent  open the door of some place where i can lock this screeching hellbabe cried sikes fiercely running to and fro and dragging the boy now as easily as if he were an empty sack that door  quick he flung him in bolted it and turned the key  is the downstairs door fast  doublelocked and chained replied crackit who with the other two men still remained quite helpless and bewildered  the panelsare they strong  lined with sheetiron  and the windows too  yes and the windows  damn you cried the desperate ruffian throwing up the sash and menacing the crowd  do your worst  ill cheat you yet  of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears none could exceed the cry of the infuriated throng  some shouted to those who were nearest to set the house on fire others roared to the officers to shoot him dead  among them all none showed such fury as the man on horseback who throwing himself out of the saddle and bursting through the crowd as if he were parting water cried beneath the window in a voice that rose above all others twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder  the nearest voices took up the cry and hundreds echoed it  some called for ladders some for sledgehammers some ran with torches to and fro as if to seek them and still came back and roared again some spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations some pressed forward with the ecstasy of madmen and thus impeded the progress of those below some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the waterspout and crevices in the wall and all waved to and fro in the darkness beneath like a field of corn moved by an angry wind  and joined from time to time in one loud furious roar  the tide cried the murderer as he staggered back into the room and shut the faces out the tide was in as i came up give me a rope a long rope  theyre all in front  i may drop into the folly ditch and clear off that way  give me a rope or i shall do three more murders and kill myself  the panicstricken men pointed to where such articles were kept the murderer hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord hurried up to the housetop  all the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked and that was too small even for the passage of his body  but from this aperture he had never ceased to call on those without to guard the back and thus when the murderer emerged at last on the housetop by the door in the roof a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front who immediately began to pour round pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream  he planted a board which he had carried up with him for the purpose so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open it from the inside and creeping over the tiles looked over the low parapet  the water was out and the ditch a bed of mud  the crowd had been hushed during these few moments watching his motions and doubtful of his purpose but the instant they perceived it and knew it was defeated they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all their previous shouting had been whispers  again and again it rose  those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning took up the sound it echoed and reechoed it seemed as though the whole city had poured its population out to curse him  on pressed the people from the fronton on on in a strong struggling current of angry faces with here and there a glaring torch to lighten them up and show them out in all their wrath and passion the houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob sashes were thrown up or torn bodily out there were tiers and tiers of faces in every window cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every housetop  each little bridge and there were three in sight bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it  still the current poured on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts and only for an instant see the wretch  they have him now cried a man on the nearest bridge hurrah  the crowd grew light with uncovered heads and again the shout uprose  i will give fifty pounds cried an old gentleman from the same quarter to the man who takes him alive  i will remain here till he come to ask me for it  there was another roar  at this moment the word was passed among the crowd that the door was forced at last and that he who had first called for the ladder had mounted into the room  the stream abruptly turned as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth and the people at the windows seeing those upon the bridges pouring back quitted their stations and running into the street joined the concourse that now thronged pellmell to the spot they had left  each man crushing and striving with his neighbor and all panting with impatience to get near the door and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out the cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion were dreadful the narrow ways were completely blocked up and at this time between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house and the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the mass the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer although the universal eagerness for his capture was if possible increased  the man had shrunk down thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd and the impossibility of escape but seeing this sudden change with no less rapidity than it had occurred he sprang upon his feet determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch and at the risk of being stifled endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and confusion  roused into new strength and energy and stimulated by the noise within the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected he set his foot against the stack of chimneys fastened one end of the rope tightly and firmly round it and with the other made a strong running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second  he could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his own height and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop  at the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to slipping it beneath his armpits and when the old gentleman beforementioned who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as to resist the force of the crowd and retain his position earnestly warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself downat that very instant the murderer looking behind him on the roof threw his arms above his head and uttered a yell of terror  the eyes again he cried in an unearthly screech  staggering as if struck by lightning he lost his balance and tumbled over the parapet  the noose was on his neck it ran up with his weight tight as a bowstring and swift as the arrow it speeds  he fell for fiveandthirty feet  there was a sudden jerk a terrific convulsion of the limbs and there he hung with the open knife clenched in his stiffening hand  the old chimney quivered with the shock but stood it bravely the murderer swung lifeless against the wall and the boy thrusting aside the dangling body which obscured his view called to the people to come and take him out for gods sake  a dog which had lain concealed till now ran backwards and forwards on the parapet with a dismal howl and collecting himself for a spring jumped for the dead mans shoulders missing his aim he fell into the ditch turning completely over as he went and striking his head against a stone dashed out his brains
