chapter xviii  how oliver passed his time in the improving society of his reputable friends  about noon next day when the dodger and master bates had gone out to pursue their customary avocations mr fagin took the opportunity of reading oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude of which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty to no ordinary extent in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends and still more in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery mr fagin laid great stress on the fact of his having taken oliver in and cherished him when without his timely aid he might have perished with hunger and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom in his philanthropy he had succoured under parallel circumstances but who proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police had unfortunately come to be hanged at the old bailey one morning  mr fagin did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe but lamented with tears in his eyes that the wrongheaded and treacherous behaviour of the young person in question had rendered it necessary that he should become the victim of certain evidence for the crown which if it were not precisely true was indispensably necessary for the safety of him mr fagin and a few select friends  mr fagin concluded by drawing a rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging and with great friendliness and politeness of manner expressed his anxious hopes that he might never be obliged to submit oliver twist to that unpleasant operation  little olivers blood ran cold as he listened to the jews words and imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them  that it was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty when they were in accidental companionship he knew already and that deeplylaid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or overcommunicative persons had been really devised and carried out by the jew on more occasions than one he thought by no means unlikely when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman and mr sikes which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy of the kind  as he glanced timidly up and met the jews searching look he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman  the jew smiling hideously patted oliver on the head and said that if he kept himself quiet and applied himself to business he saw they would be very good friends yet  then taking his hat and covering himself with an old patched greatcoat he went out and locked the roomdoor behind him  and so oliver remained all that day and for the greater part of many subsequent days seeing nobody between early morning and midnight and left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts  which never failing to revert to his kind friends and the opinion they must long ago have formed of him were sad indeed  after the lapse of a week or so the jew left the roomdoor unlocked and he was at liberty to wander about the house  it was a very dirty place  the rooms upstairs had great high wooden chimneypieces and large doors with panelled walls and cornices to the ceiling which although they were black with neglect and dust were ornamented in various ways  from all of these tokens oliver concluded that a long time ago before the old jew was born it had belonged to better people and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome  dismal and dreary as it looked now  spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings and sometimes when oliver walked softly into a room the mice would scamper across the floor and run back terrified to their holes  with these exceptions there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing and often when it grew dark and he was tired of wandering from room to room he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the streetdoor to be as near living people as he could and would remain there listening and counting the hours until the jew or the boys returned  in all the rooms the mouldering shutters were fast closed  the bars which held them were screwed tight into the wood the only light which was admitted stealing its way through round holes at the top which made the rooms more gloomy and filled them with strange shadows there was a backgarret window with rusty bars outside which had no shutter and out of this oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of housetops blackened chimneys and gableends sometimes indeed a grizzly head might be seen peering over the parapetwall of a distant house but it was quickly withdrawn again and as the window of olivers observatory was nailed down and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different objects beyond without making any attempt to be seen or heardwhich he had as much chance of being as if he had lived inside the ball of st pauls cathedral  one afternoon the dodger and master bates being engaged out that evening the firstnamed young gentleman took it into his head to evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person to do him justice this was by no means an habitual weakness with him and with this end and aim he condescendingly commanded oliver to assist him in his toilet straightway  oliver was but too glad to make himself useful too happy to have some faces however bad to look upon too desirous to conciliate those about him when he could honestly do so to throw any objection in the way of this proposal  so he at once expressed his readiness and kneeling on the floor while the dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot in his laps he applied himself to a process which mr dawkins designated as japanning his trottercases  the phrase rendered into plain english signifieth cleaning his boots  whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude smoking a pipe swinging one leg carelessly to and fro and having his boots cleaned all the time without even the past trouble of having taken them off or the prospective misery of putting them on to disturb his reflections or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed the feelings of the dodger or the mildness of the beer that mollified his thoughts he was evidently tinctured for the nonce with a spice of romance and enthusiasm foreign to his general nature he looked down on oliver with a thoughtful countenance for a brief space and then raising his head and heaving a gentle sign said half in abstraction and half to master bates  what a pity it is he isnt a prig  ah said master charles bates he dont know whats good for him  the dodger sighed again and resumed his pipe as did charley bates they both smoked for some seconds in silence  i suppose you dont even know what a prig is said the dodger mournfully  i think i know that replied oliver looking up  its a the youre one are you not inquired oliver checking himself  i am replied the doger  id scorn to be anything else  mr dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock after delivering this sentiment and looked at master bates as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying anything to the contrary  i am repeated the dodger  sos charley  sos fagin sos sikes sos nancy  sos bet  so we all are down to the dog and hes the downiest one of the lot  and the least given to peaching added charley bates  he wouldnt so much as bark in a witnessbox for fear of committing himself no not if you tied him up in one and left him there without wittles for a fortnight said the dodger  not a bit of it observed charley  hes a rum dog  dont he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or sings when hes in company pursued the dodger wont he growl at all when he hears a fiddle playing  and dont he hate other dogs as aint of his breed  oh no  hes an outandout christian said charley  this was merely intended as a tribute to the animals abilities but it was an appropriate remark in another sense if master bates had only known it for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen claiming to be outandout christians between whom and mr sikes dog there exist strong and singular points of resemblance  well well said the dodger recurring to the point from which they had strayed with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his proceedings  this hasnt go anything to do with young green here  no more it has said charley  why dont you put yourself under fagin oliver  and make your fortun out of hand added the dodger with a grin  and so be able to retire on your property and do the genteel as i mean to in the very next leapyear but four that ever comes and the fortysecond tuesday in trinityweek said charley bates  i dont like it rejoined oliver timidly i wish they would let me go  iiwould rather go  and fagin would rather not rejoined charley  oliver knew this too well but thinking it might be dangerous to express his feelings more openly he only sighed and went on with his bootcleaning  go exclaimed the dodger  why wheres your spirit dont you take any pride out of yourself  would you go and be dependent on your friends  oh blow that said master bates drawing two or three silk handkerchiefs from his pocket and tossing them into a cupboard thats too mean that is  i couldnt do it said the dodger with an air of haughty disgust  you can leave your friends though said oliver with a half smile and let them be punished for what you did  that rejoined the dodger with a wave of his pipe that was all out of consideration for fagin cause the traps know that we work together and he might have got into trouble if we hadnt made our lucky that was the move wasnt it charley  master bates nodded assent and would have spoken but the recollection of olivers flight came so suddenly upon him that the smoke he was inhaling got entangled with a laugh and went up into his head and down into his throat and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping about five minutes long  look here said the dodger drawing forth a handful of shillings and halfpence heres a jolly life  whats the odds where it comes from here catch hold theres plenty more where they were took from  you wont wont you  oh you precious flat  its naughty aint it oliver inquired charley bates hell come to be scragged wont he  i dont know what that means replied oliver  something in this way old feller said charly  as he said it master bates caught up an end of his neckerchief and holding it erect in the air dropped his head on his shoulder and jerked a curious sound through his teeth thereby indicating by a lively pantomimic representation that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing  thats what it means said charley  look how he stares jack  i never did see such prime company as that ere boy hell be the death of me i know he will  master charley bates having laughed heartily again resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes  youve been brought up bad said the dodger surveying his boots with much satisfaction when oliver had polished them fagin will make something of you though or youll be the first he ever had that turned out unprofitable  youd better begin at once for youll come to the trade long before you think of it and youre only losing time oliver  master bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own  which being exhausted he and his friend mr dawkins launched into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they led interspersed with a variety of hints to oliver that the best thing he could do would be to secure fagins favour without more delay by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it  and always put this in your pipe nolly said the dodger as the jew was heard unlocking the door above if you dont take fogels and tickers  whats the good of talking in that way interposed master bates he dont know what you mean  if you dont take pockethandkechers and watches said the dodger reducing his conversation to the level of olivers capacity some other cove will so that the coves that lose em will be all the worse and youll be all the worse too and nobody half a haporth the better except the chaps wot gets themand youve just as good a right to them as they have  to be sure to be sure said the jew who had entered unseen by oliver  it all lies in a nutshell my dear in a nutshell take the dodgers word for it  ha ha ha  he understands the catechism of his trade  the old man rubbed his hands gleefully together as he corroborated the dodgers reasoning in these terms and chuckled with delight at his pupils proficiency  the conversation proceeded no farther at this time for the jew had returned home accompanied by miss betsy and a gentleman whom oliver had never seen before but who was accosted by the dodger as tom chitling and who having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the lady now made his appearance  mr chitling was older in years than the dodger having perhaps numbered eighteen winters but there was a degree of deference in his deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional aquirements  he had small twinkling eyes and a pockmarked face wore a fur cap a dark corduroy jacket greasy fustian trousers and an apron  his wardrobe was in truth rather out of repair but he excused himself to the company by stating that his time was only out an hour before and that in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past he had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes  mr chitling added with strong marks of irritation that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional for it burnt holes in them and there was no remedy against the county  the same remark he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair which he held to be decidedly unlawful  mr chitling wound up his observations by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for fortytwo moral long hardworking days and that he wished he might be busted if he warnt as dry as a limebasket  where do you think the gentleman has come from oliver inquired the jew with a grin as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table  iidont know sir replied oliver  whos that inquired tom chitling casting a contemptuous look at oliver  a young friend of mine my dear replied the jew  hes in luck then said the young man with a meaning look at fagin never mind where i came from young un youll find your way there soon enough ill bet a crown  at this sally the boys laughed  after some more jokes on the same subject they exchanged a few short whispers with fagin and withdrew  after some words apart between the last comer and fagin they drew their chairs towards the fire and the jew telling oliver to come and sit by him led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his hearers  these were the great advantages of the trade the proficiency of the dodger the amiability of charley bates and the liberality of the jew himself  at length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly exhausted and mr chitling did the same for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two miss betsy accordingly withdrew and left the party to their repose  from this day oliver was seldom left alone but was placed in almost constant communication with the two boys who played the old game with the jew every day whether for their own improvement or olivers mr fagin best knew  at other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies he had committed in his younger days  mixed up with so much that was droll and curious that oliver could not help laughing heartily and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings  in short the wily old jew had the boy in his toils  having prepared his mind by solitude and gloom to prefer any society to the companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place he was now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it and change its hue for ever
