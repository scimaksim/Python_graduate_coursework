chapter xvii  olivers destiny continuing unpropitious brings a great man to london to injure his reputation  it is the custom on the stage in all good murderous melodramas to present the tragic and the comic scenes in as regular alternation as the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon  the hero sinks upon his straw bed weighed down by fetters and misfortunes in the next scene his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic song  we behold with throbbing bosoms the heroine in the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron her virtue and her life alike in danger drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch a whistle is heard and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle where a greyheaded seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of vassals who are free of all sorts of places from church vaults to palaces and roam about in company carolling perpetually  such changes appear absurd but they are not so unnatural as they would seem at first sight  the transitions in real life from wellspread boards to deathbeds and from mourningweeds to holiday garments are not a whit less startling only there we are busy actors instead of passive lookerson which makes a vast difference  the actors in the mimic life of the theatre are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of passion or feeling which presented before the eyes of mere spectators are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous  as sudden shiftings of the scene and rapid changes of time and place are not only sanctioned in books by long usage but are by many considered as the great art of authorship an authors skill in his craft being by such critics chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary  if so let it be considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which oliver twist was born the reader taking it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the journey or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition  mr bumble emerged at early morning from the workhousegate and walked with portly carriage and commanding steps up the high street  he was in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood his cocked hat and coat were dazzling in the morning sun he clutched his cane with the vigorous tenacity of health and power  mr bumble always carried his head high but this morning it was higher than usual  there was an abstraction in his eye an elevation in his air which might have warned an observant stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadles mind too great for utterance  mr bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others who spoke to him deferentially as he passed along  he merely returned their salutations with a wave of his hand and relaxed not in his dignified pace until he reached the farm where mrs mann tended the infant paupers with parochial care  drat that beadle said mrs mann hearing the wellknown shaking at the gardengate  if it isnt him at this time in the morning  lauk mr bumble only think of its being you  well dear me it is a pleasure this is  come into the parlour sir please  the first sentence was addressed to susan and the exclamations of delight were uttered to mr bumble as the good lady unlocked the gardengate and showed him with great attention and respect into the house  mrs mann said mr bumble not sitting upon or dropping himself into a seat as any common jackanapes would but letting himself gradually and slowly down into a chair mrs mann maam good morning  well and good morning to you sir replied mrs mann with many smiles and hoping you find yourself well sir  soso mrs mann replied the beadle  a porochial life is not a bed of roses mrs mann  ah that it isnt indeed mr bumble rejoined the lady and all the infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety if they had heard it  a porochial life maam continued mr bumble striking the table with his cane is a life of worrit and vexation and hardihood but all public characters as i may say must suffer prosecution  mrs mann not very well knowing what the beadle meant raised her hands with a look of sympathy and sighed  ah  you may well sigh mrs mann said the beadle  finding she had done right mrs mann sighed again  evidently to the satisfaction of the public character  who repressing a complacent smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat said  mrs mann i am going to london  lauk mr bumble cried mrs mann starting back  to london maam resumed the inflexible beadle by coach  i and two paupers mrs mann  a legal action is a coming on about a settlement and the board has appointed meme mrs mannto dispose to the matter before the quartersessions at clerkinwell  and i very much question added mr bumble drawing himself up whether the clerkinwell sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before they have done with me  oh you mustnt be too hard upon them sir said mrs mann coaxingly  the clerkinwell sessions have brought it upon themselves maam replied mr bumble and if the clerkinwell sessions find that they come off rather worse than they expected the clerkinwell sessions have only themselves to thank  there was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing manner in which mr bumble delivered himself of these words that mrs mann appeared quite awed by them at length she said  youre going by coach sir  i thought it was always usual to send them paupers in carts  thats when theyre ill mrs mann said the beadle  we put the sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather to prevent their taking cold  oh said mrs mann  the opposition coach contracts for these two and takes them cheap said mr bumble  they are both in a very low state and we find it would come two pound cheaper to move em than to bury emthat is if we can throw em upon another parish which i think we shall be able to do if they dont die upon the road to spite us  ha ha ha  when mr bumble had laughed a little while his eyes again encountered the cocked hat and he became grave  we are forgetting business maam said the beadle here is your porochial stipend for the month  mr bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper from his pocketbook and requested a receipt  which mrs mann wrote  its very much blotted sir said the farmer of infants but its formal enough i dare say  thank you mr bumble sir i am very much obliged to you im sure  mr bumble nodded blandly in acknowledgment of mrs manns curtsey and inquired how the children were  bless their dear little hearts said mrs mann with emotion theyre as well as can be the dears  of course except the two that died last week  and little dick  isnt that boy no better inquired mr bumble  mrs mann shook her head  hes a illconditioned wicious baddisposed porochial child that said mr bumble angrily  where is he  ill bring him to you in one minute sir replied mrs mann here you dick  after some calling dick was discovered  having had his face put under the pump and dried upon mrs manns gown he was led into the awful presence of mr bumble the beadle  the child was pale and thin his cheeks were sunken and his eyes large and bright  the scanty parish dress the livery of his misery hung loosely on his feeble body and his young limbs had wasted away like those of an old man  such was the little being who stood trembling beneath mr bumbles glance not daring to lift his eyes from the floor and dreading even to hear the beadles voice  cant you look at the gentleman you obstinate boy said mrs mann  the child meekly raised his eyes and encountered those of mr bumble  whats the matter with you porochial dick inquired mr bumble with welltimed jocularity  nothing sir replied the child faintly  i should think not said mrs mann who had of course laughed very much at mr bumbles humour  you want for nothing im sure  i should like faltered the child  heyday interposed mr mann i suppose youre going to say that you do want for something now  why you little wretch  stop mrs mann stop said the beadle raising his hand with a show of authority  like what sir eh  i should like faltered the child if somebody that can write would put a few words down for me on a piece of paper and fold it up and seal it and keep it for me after i am laid in the ground  why what does the boy mean exclaimed mr bumble on whom the earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression accustomed as he was to such things  what do you mean sir  i should like said the child to leave my dear love to poor oliver twist and to let him know how often i have sat by myself and cried to think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him  and i should like to tell him said the child pressing his small hands together and speaking with great fervour that i was glad to die when i was very young for perhaps if i had lived to be a man and had grown old my little sister who is in heaven might forget me or be unlike me and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together  mr bumble surveyed the little speaker from head to foot with indescribable astonishment and turning to his companion said theyre all in one story mrs mann  that outdacious oliver had demogalized them all  i couldnt have believed it sir said mrs mann holding up her hands and looking malignantly at dick  i never see such a hardened little wretch  take him away maam said mr bumble imperiously  this must be stated to the board mrs mann  i hope the gentleman will understand that it isnt my fault sir said mrs mann whimpering pathetically  they shall understand that maam they shall be acquainted with the true state of the case said mr bumble  there take him away i cant bear the sight on him  dick was immediately taken away and locked up in the coalcellar  mr bumble shortly afterwards took himself off to prepare for his journey  at six oclock next morning mr bumble  having exchanged his cocked hat for a round one and encased his person in a blue greatcoat with a cape to it  took his place on the outside of the coach accompanied by the criminals whose settlement was disputed with whom in due course of time he arrived in london  he experienced no other crosses on the way than those which originated in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers who persisted in shivering and complaining of the cold in a manner which mr bumble declared caused his teeth to chatter in his head and made him feel quite uncomfortable although he had a greatcoat on  having disposed of these evilminded persons for the night mr bumble sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped and took a temperate dinner of steaks oyster sauce and porter putting a glass of hot ginandwater on the chimneypiece he drew his chair to the fire and with sundry moral reflections on the tooprevalent sin of discontent and complaining composed himself to read the paper  the very first paragraph upon which mr bumbles eye rested was the following advertisement                   five guineas reward  whereas a young boy named oliver twist absconded or was enticed on thursday evening last from his home at pentonville and has not since been heard of  the above reward will be paid to any person who will give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said oliver twist or tend to throw any light upon his previous history in which the advertiser is for many reasons warmly interested  and then followed a full description of olivers dress person appearance and disappearance  with the name and address of mr brownlow at full length  mr bumble opened his eyes read the advertisement slowly and carefully three several times and in something more than five minutes was on his way to pentonville having actually in his excitement left the glass of hot ginandwater untasted  is mr brownlow at home inquired mr bumble of the girl who opened the door  to this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon but rather evasive reply of i dont know where do you come from  mr bumble no sooner uttered olivers name in explanation of his errand than mrs bedwin who had been listening at the parlour door hastened into the passage in a breathless state  come in come in said the old lady i knew we should hear of him poor dear  i knew we should  i was certain of it  bless his heart i said so all along  having heard this the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour again and seating herself on a sofa burst into tears the girl who was not quite so susceptible had run upstairs meanwhile and now returned with a request that mr bumble would follow her immediately which he did  he was shown into the little back study where sat mr brownlow and his friend mr grimwig with decanters and glasses before them  the latter gentleman at once burst into the exclamation  a beadle  a parish beadle or ill eat my head  pray dont interrupt just now said mr brownlow  take a seat will you  mr bumble sat himself down quite confounded by the oddity of mr grimwigs manner  mr brownlow moved the lamp so as to obtain an uninterrupted view of the beadles countenance and said with a little impatience  now sir you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement  yes sir said mr bumble  and you are a beadle are you not inquired mr grimwig  i am a porochial beadle gentlemen rejoined mr bumble proudly  of course observed mr grimwig aside to his friend i knew he was a beadle all over  mr brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend and resumed  do you know where this poor boy is now  no more than nobody replied mr bumble  well what do you know of him inquired the old gentleman speak out my friend if you have anything to say  what do you know of him  you dont happen to know any good of him do you said mr grimwig caustically after an attentive perusal of mr bumbles features  mr bumble catching at the inquiry very quickly shook his head with portentous solemnity  you see said mr grimwig looking triumphantly at mr brownlow  mr brownlow looked apprehensively at mr bumbles pursedup countenance and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding oliver in as few words as possible  mr bumble put down his hat unbuttoned his coat folded his arms inclined his head in a retrospective manner and after a few moments reflection commenced his story  it would be tedious if given in the beadles words  occupying as it did some twenty minutes in the telling but the sum and substance of it was that oliver was a foundling born of low and vicious parents that he had from his birth displayed no better qualities than treachery ingratitude and malice  that he had terminated his brief career in the place of his birth by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad and running away in the nighttime from his masters house  in proof of his really being the person he represented himself mr bumble laid upon the table the papers he had brought to town folding his arms again he then awaited mr brownlows observations  i fear it is all too true said the old gentleman sorrowfully after looking over the papers  this is not much for your intelligence but i would gladly have given you treble the money if it had been favourable to the boy  it is not improbable that if mr bumble had been possessed of this information at an earlier period of the interview he might have imparted a very different colouring to his little history it was too late to do it now however so he shook his head gravely and pocketing the five guineas withdrew  mr brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes evidently so much disturbed by the beadles tale that even mr grimwig forbore to vex him further  at length he stopped and rang the bell violently  mrs bedwin said mr brownlow when the housekeeper appeared that boy oliver is an imposter  it cant be sir  it cannot be said the old lady energetically  i tell you he is retorted the old gentleman  what do you mean by cant be  we have just heard a full account of him from his birth and he has been a thoroughpaced little villain all his life  i never will believe it sir replied the old lady firmly never  you old women never believe anything but quackdoctors and lying storybooks growled mr grimwig  i knew it all along why didnt you take my advise in the beginning you would if he hadnt had a fever i suppose eh  he was interesting wasnt he  interesting bah  and mr grimwig poked the fire with a flourish  he was a dear grateful gentle child sir retorted mrs bedwin indignantly  i know what children are sir and have done these forty years and people who cant say the same shouldnt say anything about them  thats my opinion  this was a hard hit at mr grimwig who was a bachelor  as it extorted nothing from that gentleman but a smile the old lady tossed her head and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech when she was stopped by mr brownlow  silence said the old gentleman feigning an anger he was far from feeling  never let me hear the boys name again  i rang to tell you that  never  never on any pretence mind  you may leave the room mrs bedwin  remember  i am in earnest  there were sad hearts at mr brownlows that night  olivers heart sank within him when he thought of his good friends it was well for him that he could not know what they had heard or it might have broken outright
