chapter viii  oliver walks to london  he encounters on the road a strange sort of young gentleman  oliver reached the stile at which the bypath terminated and once more gained the highroad  it was eight oclock now though he was nearly five miles away from the town he ran and hid behind the hedges by turns till noon fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken  then he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone and began to think for the first time where he had better go and try to live  the stone by which he was seated bore in large characters an intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to london the name awakened a new train of ideas in the boys mind  londonthat great placenobodynot even mr bumblecould ever find him there  he had often heard the old men in the workhouse too say that no lad of spirit need want in london and that there were ways of living in that vast city which those who had been bred up in country parts had no idea of  it was the very place for a homeless boy who must die in the streets unless some one helped him as these things passed through his thoughts he jumped upon his feet and again walked forward  he had diminished the distance between himself and london by full four miles more before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could hope to reach his place of destination as this consideration forced itself upon him he slackened his pace a little and meditated upon his means of getting there  he had a crust of bread a coarse shirt and two pairs of stockings in his bundle  he had a penny tooa gift of sowerberrys after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily wellin his pocket a clean shirt thought oliver is a very comfortable thing and so are two pairs of darned stockings and so is a penny but they are small helps to a sixtyfive miles walk in winter time  but olivers thoughts like those of most other people although they were extremely ready and active to point out his difficulties were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of surmounting them so after a good deal of thinking to no particular purpose he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder and trudged on  oliver walked twenty miles that day and all that time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread and a few draughts of water which he begged at the cottagedoors by the roadside  when the night came he turned into a meadow and creeping close under a hayrick determined to lie there till morning  he felt frightened at first for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields and he was cold and hungry and more alone than he had ever felt before  being very tired with his walk however he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles  he felt cold and stiff when he got up next morning and so hungry that he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf in the very first village through which he passed  he had walked no more than twelve miles when night closed in again his feet were sore and his legs so weak that they trembled beneath him  another night passed in the bleak damp air made him worse when he set forward on his journey next morning he could hardly crawl along  he waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stagecoach came up and then begged of the outside passengers but there were very few who took any notice of him and even those told him to wait till they got to the top of the hill and then let them see how far he could run for a halfpenny  poor oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way but was unable to do it by reason of his fatigue and sore feet  when the outsides saw this they put their halfpence back into their pockets again declaring that he was an idle young dog and didnt deserve anything and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind  in some villages large painted boards were fixed up warning all persons who begged within the district that they would be sent to jail  this frightened oliver very much and made him glad to get out of those villages with all possible expedition  in others he would stand about the innyards and look mournfully at every one who passed a proceeding which generally terminated in the landladys ordering one of the postboys who were lounging about to drive that strange boy out of the place for she was sure he had come to steal something  if he begged at a farmers house ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him and when he showed his nose in a shop they talked about the beadlewhich brought olivers heart into his mouthvery often the only thing he had there for many hours together  in fact if it had not been for a goodhearted turnpikeman and a benevolent old lady olivers troubles would have been shortened by the very same process which had put an end to his mothers in other words he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the kings highway  but the turnpikeman gave him a meal of bread and cheese and the old lady who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the earth took pity upon the poor orphan and gave him what little she could affordand morewith such kind and gentle words and such tears of sympathy and compassion that they sank deeper into olivers soul than all the sufferings he had ever undergone  early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place oliver limped slowly into the little town of barnet the windowshutters were closed the street was empty not a soul had awakened to the business of the day  the sun was rising in all its splendid beauty but the light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation as he sat with bleeding feet and covered with dust upon a doorstep  by degrees the shutters were opened the windowblinds were drawn up and people began passing to and fro  some few stopped to gaze at oliver for a moment or two or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by but none relieved him or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there he had no heart to beg and there he sat  he had been crouching on the step for some time wondering at the great number of publichouses every other house in barnet was a tavern large or small gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do with ease in a few hours what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination beyond his years to accomplish when he was roused by observing that a boy who had passed him carelessly some minutes before had returned and was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way  he took little heed of this at first but the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long that oliver raised his head and returned his steady look  upon this the boy crossed over and walking close up to oliver said  hullo my covey  whats the row  the boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer was about his own age but one of the queerest looking boys that oliver had even seen  he was a snubnosed flatbrowed commonfaced boy enough and as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see but he had about him all the airs and manners of a man  he was short of his age with rather bowlegs and little sharp ugly eyes  his hat was stuck on the top of his head so lightly that it threatened to fall off every momentand would have done so very often if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch which brought it back to its old place again  he wore a mans coat which reached nearly to his heels  he had turned the cuffs back halfway up his arm to get his hands out of the sleeves apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy trousers for there he kept them  he was altogether as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six or something less in the bluchers  hullo my covey  whats the row said this strange young gentleman to oliver  i am very hungry and tired replied oliver the tears standing in his eyes as he spoke i have walked a long way  i have been walking these seven days  walking for sivin days said the young gentleman  oh i see beaks order eh  but he added noticing olivers look of surprise i suppose you dont know what a beak is my flash companion  oliver mildly replied that he had always heard a birds mouth described by the term in question  my eyes how green exclaimed the young gentleman why a beaks a madgstrate and when you walk by a beaks order its not straight forerd but always agoing up and niver a coming down agin  was you never on the mill  what mill inquired oliver  what mill  why the millthe mill as takes up so little room that itll work inside a stone jug and always goes better when the winds low with people than when its high acos then they cant get workmen but come said the young gentleman you want grub and you shall have it  im at lowwatermark myselfonly one bob and a magpie but as far as it goes ill fork out and stump  up with you on your pins there  now then morrice  assisting oliver to rise the young gentleman took him to an adjacent chandlers shop where he purchased a sufficiency of readydressed ham and a halfquartern loaf or as he himself expressed it a fourpenny bran the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust by the ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the crumb and stuffing it therein  taking the bread under his arm the young gentlman turned into a small publichouse and led the way to a taproom in the rear of the premises here a pot of beer was brought in by direction of the mysterious youth and oliver falling to at his new friends bidding made a long and hearty meal during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention  going to london said the strange boy when oliver had at length concluded  yes  got any lodgings  no  money  no  the strange boy whistled and put his arms into his pockets as far as the big coatsleeves would let them go  do you live in london inquired oliver  yes i do when im at home replied the boy i suppose you want some place to sleep in tonight dont you  i do indeed answered oliver i have not slept under a roof since i left the country  dont fret your eyelids on that score said the young gentleman ive got to be in london tonight and i know a spectable old gentleman as lives there wotll give you lodgings for nothink and never ask for the changethat is if any genelman he knows interduces you and dont he know me  oh no not in the least  by no means certainly not  the young gentleman smiled as if to intimate that the latter fragments of discourse were playfully ironical and finished the beer as he did so  this unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted especially as it was immediately followed up by the assurance that the old gentleman referred to would doubtless provide oliver with a comfortable place without loss of time  this led to a more friendly and confidential dialogue from which oliver discovered that his friends name was jack dawkins and that he was a peculiar pet and protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned  mr dawkins appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts which his patrons interest obtained for those whom he took under his protection but as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of conversing and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was better known by the sobriquet of the artful dodger oliver concluded that being of a dissipated and careless turn the moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him  under this impression he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible and if he found the dodger incorrigible as he more than half suspected he should to decline the honour of his farther acquaintance  as john dawkins objected to their entering london before nightfall it was nearly eleven oclock when they reached the turnpike at islington they crossed from the angel into st johns road struck down the small street which terminates at sadlers wells theatre through exmouth street and coppice row down the little court by the side of the workhouse across the classic ground which once bore the name of hockleyinthehole thence into little saffron hill and so into saffron hill the great along which the dodger scudded at a rapid pace directing oliver to follow close at his heels  although oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his leader he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of the way as he passed along  a dirtier or more wretched place he had never seen  the street was very narrow and muddy and the air was impregnated with filthy odours  there were a good many small shops but the only stock in trade appeared to be heaps of children who even at that time of night were crawling in and out at the doors or screaming from the inside  the sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place were the publichouses and in them the lowest orders of irish were wrangling with might and main covered ways and yards which here and there diverged from the main street disclosed little knots of houses where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth and from several of the doorways great illlooking fellows were cautiously emerging bound to all appearance on no very welldisposed or harmless errands  oliver was just considering whether he hadnt better run away when they reached the bottom of the hill  his conductor catching him by the arm pushed open the door of a house near field lane and drawing him into the passage closed it behind them  now then cried a voice from below in reply to a whistle from the dodger  plummy and slam was the reply  this seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right for the light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the passage and a mans face peeped out from where a balustrade of the old kitchen staircase had been broken away  theres two on you said the man thrusting the candle farther out and shielding his eyes with his hand  whos the tother one  a new pal replied jack dawkins pulling oliver forward  where did he come from  greenland is fagin upstairs  yes hes a sortin the wipes  up with you  the candle was drawn back and the face disappeared  oliver groping his way with one hand and having the other firmly grasped by his companion ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken stairs which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that showed he was well acquainted with them  he threw open the door of a backroom and drew oliver in after him  the walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt  there was a deal table before the fire upon which were a candle stuck in a gingerbeer bottle two or three pewter pots a loaf and butter and a plate  in a fryingpan which was on the fire and which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string some sausages were cooking and standing over them with a toastingfork in his hand was a very old shrivelled jew whose villainouslooking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair he was dressed in a greasy flannel gown with his throat bare and seemed to be dividing his attention between the fryingpan and the clotheshorse over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging  several rough beds made of old sacks were huddled side by side on the floor seated round the table were four or five boys none older than the dodger smoking long clay pipes and drinking spirits with the air of middleaged men these all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to the jew and then turned round and grinned at oliver  so did the jew himself toastingfork in hand  this is him fagin said jack dawkinsmy friend oliver twist  the jew grinned and making a low obeisance to oliver took him by the hand and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance upon this the young gentleman with the pipes came round him and shook both his hands very hardespecially the one in which he held his little bundle  one young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for him and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets in order that as he was very tired he might not have the trouble of emptying them himself when he went to bed  these civilities would probably be extended much farther but for a liberal exercise of the jews toastingfork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who offered them  we are very glad to see you oliver very said the jew dodger take off the sausages and draw a tub near the fire for oliver  ah youre astaring at the pockethandkerchiefs eh my dear there are a good many of em aint there weve just looked em out ready for the wash thats all oliver thats all ha ha ha  the latter part of this speech was hailed by a boisterous shout from all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman in the midst of which they went to supper  oliver ate his share and the jew then mixed him a glass of hot ginandwater telling him he must drink it off directly because another gentleman wanted the tumbler oliver did as he was desired immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks and then he sunk into a deep sleep
