chapter xl  a strange interview which is a sequel to the last chamber  the girls life had been squandered in the streets and among the most noisome of the stews and dens of london but there was something of the womans original nature left in her still and when she heard a light step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment contain she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she had sought this interview  but struggling with these better feelings was pridethe vice of the lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and selfassured  the miserable companion of thieves and ruffians the fallen outcast of low haunts the associate of the scourings of the jails and hulks living within the shadow of the gallows itselfeven this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly feeling which she thought a weakness but which alone connected her with that humanity of which her wasting life had obliterated so many many traces when a very child  she raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl then bending them on the ground she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she said  its a hard matter to get to see you lady  if i had taken offence and gone away as many would have done youd have been sorry for it one day and not without reason either  i am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you replied rose do not think of that  tell me why you wished to see me i am the person you inquired for  the kind tone of this answer the sweet voice the gentle manner the absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure took the girl completely by surprise and she burst into tears  oh lady lady she said clasping her hands passionately before her face if there was more like you there would be fewer like methere wouldthere would  sit down said rose earnestly  if you are in poverty or affliction i shall be truly glad to relieve you if i cani shall indeed  sit down  let me stand lady said the girl still weeping and do not speak to me so kindly till you know me better  it is growing late isisthat door shut  yes said rose recoiling a few steps as if to be nearer assistance in case she should require it  why  because said the girl i am about to put my life and the lives of others in your hands  i am the girl that dragged little oliver back to old fagins on the night he went out from the house in pentonville  you said rose maylie  i lady replied the girl  i am the infamous creature you have heard of that lives among the thieves and that never from the first moment i can recollect my eyes and senses opening on london streets have known any better life or kinder words than they have given me so help me god  do not mind shrinking openly from me lady  i am younger than you would think to look at me but i am well used to it the poorest women fall back as i make my way along the crowded pavement  what dreadful things are these said rose involuntarily falling from her strange companion  thank heaven upon your knees dear lady cried the girl that you had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood and that you were never in the midst of cold and hunger and riot and drunkenness andandsomething worse than allas i have been from my cradle  i may use the word for the alley and the gutter were mine as they will be my deathbed  i pity you said rose in a broken voice  it wrings my heart to hear you  heaven bless you for your goodness rejoined the girl if you knew what i am sometimes you would pity me indeed but i have stolen away from those who would surely murder me if they knew i had been here to tell you what i have overheard  do you know a man named monks  no said rose  he knows you replied the girl and knew you were here for it was by hearing him tell the place that i found you out  i never heard the name said rose  then he goes by some other amongst us rejoined the girl which i more than thought before  some time ago and soon after oliver was put into your house on the night of the robbery isuspecting this manlistened to a conversation held between him and fagin in the dark i found out from what i heard that monksthe man i asked you about you know  yes said rose i understand  that monks pursued the girl had seen him accidently with two of our boys on the day we first lost him and had known him directly to be the same child that he was watching for though i couldnt make out why  a bargain was struck with fagin that if oliver was got back he should have a certain sum and he was to have more for making him a thief which this monks wanted for some purpose of his own  for what purpose asked rose  he caught sight of my shadow on the wall as i listened in the hope of finding out said the girl and there are not many people besides me that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery  but i did and i saw him no more till last night  and what occurred then  ill tell you lady  last night he came again  again they went upstairs and i wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me again listened at the door  the first words i heard monks say were these  so the only proofs of the boys identity lie at the bottom of the river and the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin  they laughed and talked of his success in doing this and monks talking on about the boy and getting very wild said that though he had got the young devils money safely now hed rather have had it the other way for what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the fathers will by driving him through every jail in town and then hauling him up for some capital felony which fagin could easily manage after having made a good profit of him besides  what is all this said rose  the truth lady though it comes from my lips replied the girl then he said with oaths common enough in my ears but strange to yours that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boys life without bringing his own neck in danger he would but as he couldnt hed be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life and if he took advantage of his birth and history he might harm him yet in short fagin he says jew as you are you never laid such snares as ill contrive for my young brother oliver  his brother exclaimed rose  those were his words said nancy glancing uneasily round as she had scarcely ceased to do since she began to speak for a vision of sikes haunted her perpetually  and more when he spoke of you and the other lady and said it seemed contrived by heaven or the devil against him that oliver should come into your hands he laughed and said there was some comfort in that too for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands of pounds would you not give if you had them to know who your twolegged spaniel was  you do not mean said rose turning very pale to tell me that this was said in earnest  he spoke in hard and angry earnest if a man ever did replied the girl shaking her head  he is an earnest man when his hatred is up i know many who do worse things but id rather listen to them all a dozen times than to that monks once  it is growing late and i have to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as this  i must get back quickly  but what can i do said rose  to what use can i turn this communication without you  back  why do you wish to return to companions you paint in such terrible colors  if you repeat this information to a gentleman whom i can summon in an instant from the next room you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an hours delay  i wish to go back said the girl  i must go back becausehow can i tell such things to an innocent lady like youbecause among the men i have told you of there is one the most desperate among them all that i cant leave  no not even to be saved from the life i am leading now  your having interfered in this dear boys behalf before said rose your coming here at so great a risk to tell me what you have heard your manner which convinces me of the truth of what you say your evident contrition and sense of shame all lead me to believe that you might yet be reclaimed  oh said the earnest girl folding her hands as the tears coursed down her face do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of your own sex the firstthe first i do believe who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion  do hear my words and let me save you yet for better things  lady cried the girl sinking on her knees dear sweet angel lady you are the first that ever blessed me with such words as these and if i had heard them years ago they might have turned me from a life of sin and sorrow but it is too late it is too late  it is never too late said rose for penitence and atonement  it is cried the girl writhing in agony of her mind i cannot leave him now  i could not be his death  why should you be asked rose  nothing could save him cried the girl  if i told others what i have told you and led to their being taken he would be sure to die he is the boldest and has been so cruel  is it possible cried rose that for such a man as this you can resign every future hope and the certainty of immediate rescue  it is madness  i dont know what it is answered the girl i only know that it is so and not with me alone but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as myself  i must go back  whether it is gods wrath for the wrong i have done i do not know but i am drawn back to him through every suffering and ill usage and i should be i believe if i knew that i was to die by his hand at last  what am i to do said rose  i should not let you depart from me thus  you should lady and i know you will rejoined the girl rising you will not stop my going because i have trusted in your goodness and forced no promise from you as i might have done  of what use then is the communication you have made said rose this mystery must be investigated or how will its disclosure to me benefit oliver whom you are anxious to serve  you must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a secret and advise you what to do rejoined the girl  but where can i find you again when it is necessary asked rose  i do not seek to know where these dreadful people live but where will you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time  will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept and come alone or with the only other person that knows it and that i shall not be watched or followed asked the girl  i promise you solemnly answered rose  every sunday night from eleven until the clock strikes twelve said the girl without hesitation i will walk on london bridge if i am alive  stay another moment interposed rose as the girl moved hurriedly towards the door  think once again on your own condition and the opportunity you have of escaping from it  you have a claim on me  not only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence but as a woman lost almost beyond redemption  will you return to this gang of robbers and to this man when a word can save you  what fascination is it that can take you back and make you cling to wickedness and misery  oh is there no chord in your heart that i can touch  is there nothing left to which i can appeal against this terrible infatuation  when ladies as young and good and beautiful as you are replied the girl steadily give away your hearts love will carry you all lengthseven such as you who have home friends other admirers everything to fill them  when such as i who have no certain roof but the coffinlid and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse set our rotten hearts on any man and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all our wretched lives who can hope to cure us  pity us ladypity us for having only one feeling of the woman left and for having that turned by a heavy judgment from a comfort and a pride into a new means of violence and suffering  you will said rose after a pause take some money from me which may enable you to live without dishonestyat all events until we meet again  not a penny replied the girl waving her hand  do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you said rose stepping gently forward  i wish to serve you indeed  you would serve me best lady replied the girl wringing her hands if you could take my life at once for i have felt more grief to think of what i am tonight than i ever did before and it would be something not to die in the hell in which i have lived  god bless you sweet lady and send as much happiness on your head as i have brought shame on mine  thus speaking and sobbing aloud the unhappy creature turned away while rose maylie overpowered by this extraordinary interview which had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence sank into a chair and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts
