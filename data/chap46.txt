chapter xliv  the time arrives for nancy to redeem her pledge to rose maylie she fails  adept as she was in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation the girl nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step she had taken wrought upon her mind  she remembered that both the crafty jew and the brutal sikes had confided to her schemes which had been hidden from all others in the full confidence that she was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion  vile as those schemes were desperate as were their originators and bitter as were her feelings towards fagin who had led her step by step deeper and deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery whence was no escape still there were times when even towards him she felt some relenting lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded and he should fall at lastrichly as he merited such a fateby her hand  but these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach itself from old companions and associations though enabled to fix itself steadily on one object and resolved not to be turned aside by any consideration  her fears for sikes would have been more powerful inducements to recoil while there was yet time but she had stipulated that her secret should be rigidly kept she had dropped no clue which could lead to his discovery she had refused even for his sake a refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses herand what more could she do she was resolved  though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion they forced themselves upon her again and again and left their traces too she grew pale and thin even within a few days  at times she took no heed of what was passing before her or no part in conversations where once she would have been the loudest  at other times she laughed without merriment and was noisy without a moment afterwardsshe sat silent and dejected brooding with her head upon her hands while the very effort by which she roused herself told more forcibly than even these indications that she was ill at ease and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her companions  it was sunday night and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour  sikes and the jew were talking but they paused to listen  the girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched and listened too  eleven  an hour this side of midnight said sikes raising the blind to look out and returning to his seat  dark and heavy it is too a good night for business this  ah replied fagin  what a pity bill my dear that theres none quite ready to be done  youre right for once replied sikes gruffly  it is a pity for im in the humour too  fagin sighed and shook his head despondingly  we must make up for lost time when weve got things into a good train thats all i know said sikes  thats the way to talk my dear replied fagin venturing to pat him on the shoulder  it does me good to hear you  does you good does it cried sikes  well so be it  ha ha ha laughed fagin as if he were relieved by even this concession  youre like yourself tonight bill  quite like yourself  i dont feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my shoulder so take it away said sikes casting off the jews hand  it make you nervous billreminds you of being nabbed does it said fagin determined not to be offended  reminds me of being nabbed by the devil returned sikes there never was another man with such a face as yours unless it was your father and i suppose he is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time unless you came straight from the old un without any father at all betwixt you which i shouldnt wonder at a bit  fagin offered no reply to this compliment  but pulling sikes by the sleeve pointed his finger towards nancy who had taken advantage of the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet and was now leaving the room  hallo cried sikes  nance  wheres the gal going to at this time of night  not far  what answers that retorted sikes  do you hear me  i dont know where replied the girl  then i do said sikes more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed nowhere  sit down  im not well  i told you that before rejoined the girl  i want a breath of air  put your head out of the winder replied sikes  theres not enough there said the girl  i want it in the street  then you wont have it replied sikes  with which assurance he rose locked the door took the key out and pulling her bonnet from her head flung it up to the top of an old press  there said the robber  now stop quietly where you are will you  its not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me said the girl turning very pale  what do you mean bill  do you know what youre doing  know what imoh cried sikes turning to fagin shes out of her senses you know or she darent talk to me in that way  youll drive me on the something desperate muttered the girl placing both hands upon her breast as though to keep down by force some violent outbreak  let me go will youthis minutethis instant  no said sikes  tell him to let me go fagin  he had better  itll be better for him  do you hear me cried nancy stamping her foot upon the ground  hear you repeated sikes turning round in his chair to confront her aye  and if i hear you for half a minute longer the dog shall have such a grip on your throat asll tear some of that screaming voice out wot has come over you you jade  wot is it  let me go said the girl with great earnestness then sitting herself down on the floor before the door she said bill let me go you dont know what you are doing you dont indeed  for only one hourdodo  cut my limbs off one by one cried sikes seizing her roughly by the arm if i dont think the gals stark raving mad  get up  not till you let me gonot till you let me gonevernever screamed the girl  sikes looked on for a minute watching his opportunity and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her struggling and wrestling with him by the way into a small room adjoining where he sat himself on a bench and thrusting her into a chair held her down by force  she struggled and implored by turns until twelve oclock had struck and then wearied and exhausted ceased to contest the point any further  with a caution backed by many oaths to make no more efforts to go out that night sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined fagin  whew said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face wot a precious strange gal that is  you may say that bill replied fagin thoughtfully  you may say that  wot did she take it into her head to go out tonight for do you think asked sikes  come you should know her better than me wot does it mean  obstinacy womans obstinacy i suppose my dear  well i suppose it is growled sikes  i thought i had tamed her but shes as bad as ever  worse said fagin thoughtfully  i never knew her like this for such a little cause  nor i said sikes  i think shes got a touch of that fever in her blood yet and it wont come outeh  like enough  ill let her a little blood without troubling the doctor if shes took that way again said sikes  fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment  she was hanging about me all day and night too when i was stretched on my back and you like a blackhearted wolf as you are kept yourself aloof said sikes  we was poor too all the time and i think one way or other its worried and fretted her and that being shut up here so long has made her restlesseh  thats it my dear replied the jew in a whisper  hush  as he uttered these words the girl herself appeared and resumed her former seat  her eyes were swollen and red she rocked herself to and fro tossed her head and after a little time burst out laughing  why now shes on the other tack exclaimed sikes turning a look of excessive surprise on his companion  fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then and in a few minutes the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour whispering sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing fagin took up his hat and bade him goodnight  he paused when he reached the roomdoor and looking round asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs  light him down said sikes who was filling his pipe its a pity he should break his neck himself and disappoint the sightseers  show him a light  nancy followed the old man downstairs with a candle  when they reached the passage he laid his finger on his lip and drawing close to the girl said in a whisper  what is it nancy dear  what do you mean replied the girl in the same tone  the reason of all this replied fagin  if hehe pointed with his skinny forefinger up the stairsis so hard with you hes a brute nance a brutebeast why dont you  well said the girl as fagin paused with his mouth almost touching her ear and his eyes looking into hers  no matter just now  well talk of this again  you have a friend in me nance a staunch friend  i have the means at hand quiet and close  if you want revenge on those that treat you like a doglike a dog  worse than his dog for he humours him sometimescome to me  i say come to me  he is the mere hound of a day but you know me of old nance  i know you well replied the girl without manifesting the least emotion  goodnight  she shrank back as fagin offered to lay his hand on hers but said goodnight again in a steady voice and answering his parting look with a nod of intelligence closed the door between them  fagin walked towards his home intent upon the thoughts that were working within his brain  he had conceived the ideanot from what had just passed though that had tended to confirm him but slowly and by degreesthat nancy wearied of the housebreakers brutality had conceived an attachment for some new friend  her altered manner her repeated absences from home alone her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous and added to these her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour all favoured the supposition and rendered it to him at least almost matter of certainty  the object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons  he would be a valuable acquisition with such an assistant as nancy and must thus fagin argued be secured without delay  there was another and a darker object to be gained  sikes knew too much and his ruffian taunts had not galled fagin the less because the wounds were hidden  the girl must know well that if she shook him off she could never be safe from his fury and that it would be surely wreakedto the maiming of limbs or perhaps the loss of lifeon the object of her more recent fancy  with a little persuasion thought fagin what more likely than that she would consent to poison him  women have done such things and worse to secure the same object before now  there would be the dangerous villain  the man i hate  gone another secured in his place and my influence over the girl with a knowledge of this crime to back it unlimited  these things passed through the mind of fagin during the short time he sat alone in the housebreakers room and with them uppermost in his thoughts he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him of sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting  there was no expression of surprise no assumption of an inability to understand his meaning  the girl clearly comprehended it  her glance at parting showed that  but perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of sikes and that was one of the chief ends to be attained how thought fagin as he crept homeward can i increase my influence with her  what new power can i acquire  such brains are fertile in expedients  if without extracting a confession from herself he laid a watch discovered the object of her altered regard and threatened to reveal the whole history to sikes of whom she stood in no common fear unless she entered into his designs could he not secure her compliance  i can said fagin almost aloud  she durst not refuse me then  not for her life not for her life  i have it all  the means are ready and shall be set to work  i shall have you yet  he cast back a dark look and a threatening motion of the hand towards the spot where he had left the bolder villain and went on his way busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment which he wrenched tightly in his grasp as though there were a hated enemy crushed with every motion of his fingers
