chapter ix  containing further particulars concerning the pleasant old gentleman and his hopeful pupils  it was late next morning when oliver awoke from a sound long sleep there was no other person in the room but the old jew who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round with an iron spoon he would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below and when he had satisfied himself he would go on whistling and stirring again as before  although oliver had roused himself from sleep he was not thoroughly awake there is a drowsy state between sleeping and waking when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness at such time a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers its bounding from earth and spurning time and space when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate  oliver was precisely in this condition he saw the jew with his halfclosed eyes heard his low whistling and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepans sides and yet the selfsame senses were mentally engaged at the same time in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known  when the coffee was done the jew drew the saucepan to the hob standing then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes as if he did not well know how to employ himself he turned round and looked at oliver and called him by his name he did not answer and was to all appearances asleep  after satisfying himself upon this head the jew stepped gently to the door which he fastened he then drew forth as it seemed to oliver from some trap in the floor a small box which he placed carefully on the table his eyes glistened as he raised the lid and looked in dragging an old chair to the table he sat down and took from it a magnificent gold watch sparkling with jewels  aha said the jew shrugging up his shoulders and distorting every feature with a hideous grin clever dogs clever dogs staunch to the last never told the old parson where they were never poached upon old fagin and why should they it wouldnt have loosened the knot or kept the drop up a minute longer no no no fine fellows fine fellows  with these and other muttered reflections of the like nature the jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety at least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box and surveyed with equal pleasure besides rings brooches bracelets and other articles of jewellery of such magnificent materials and costly workmanship that oliver had no idea even of their names  having replaced these trinkets the jew took out another so small that it lay in the palm of his hand there seemed to be some very minute inscription on it for the jew laid it flat upon the table and shading it with his hand pored over it long and earnestly at length he put it down as if despairing of success and leaning back in his chair muttered  what a fine thing capital punishment is dead men never repent dead men never bring awkward stories to light ah its a fine thing for the trade five of em strung up in a row and none left to play booty or turn whitelivered  as the jew uttered these words his bright dark eyes which had been staring vacantly before him fell on olivers face the boys eyes were fixed on his in mute curiousity and although the recognition was only for an instantfor the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceivedit was enough to show the old man that he had been observed  he closed the lid of the box with a loud crash and laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table started furiously up he trembled very much though for even in his terror oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air  whats that said the jew what do you watch me for why are you awake what have you seen speak out boy quickquick for your life  i wasnt able to sleep any longer sir replied oliver meekly i am very sorry if i have disturbed you sir  you were not awake an hour ago said the jew scowling fiercely on the boy  no no indeed replied oliver  are you sure cried the jew with a still fiercer look than before and a threatening attitude  upon my word i was not sir replied oliver earnestly i was not indeed sir  tush tush my dear said the jew abruptly resuming his old manner and playing with the knife a little before he laid it down as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up in mere sport of course i know that my dear i only tried to frighten you youre a brave boy ha ha youre a brave boy oliver the jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle but glanced uneasily at the box notwithstanding  did you see any of these pretty things my dear said the jew laying his hand upon it after a short pause  yes sir replied oliver  ah said the jew turning rather pale theytheyre mine oliver my little property all i have to live upon in my old age the folks call me a miser my dear only a miser thats all  oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place with so many watches but thinking that perhaps his fondness for the dodger and the other boys cost him a good deal of money he only cast a deferential look at the jew and asked if he might get up  certainly my dear certainly replied the old gentleman stay theres a pitcher of water in the corner by the door bring it here and ill give you a basin to wash in my dear  oliver got up walked across the room and stooped for an instant to raise the pitcher  when he turned his head the box was gone  he had scarcely washed himself and made everything tidy by emptying the basin out of the window agreeably to the jews directions when the dodger returned accompanied by a very sprightly young friend whom oliver had seen smoking on the previous night and who was now formally introduced to him as charley bates the four sat down to breakfast on the coffee and some hot rolls and ham which the dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat  well said the jew glancing slyly at oliver and addressing himself to the dodger i hope youve been at work this morning my dears  hard replied the dodger  as nails added charley bates  good boys good boys said the jew what have you got dodger  a couple of pocketbooks replied that young gentlman  lined inquired the jew with eagerness  pretty well replied the dodger producing two pocketbooks one green and the other red  not so heavy as they might be said the jew after looking at the insides carefully but very neat and nicely made  ingenious workman aint he oliver  very indeed sir said oliver at which mr charles bates laughed uproariously very much to the amazement of oliver who saw nothing to laugh at in anything that had passed  and what have you got my dear said fagin to charley bates  wipes replied master bates at the same time producing four pockethandkerchiefs  well said the jew inspecting them closely theyre very good ones very you havent marked them well though charley so the marks shall be picked out with a needle and well teach oliver how to do it shall us oliver eh ha ha ha  if you please sir said oliver  youd like to be able to make pockethandkerchiefs as easy as charley bates wouldnt you my dear said the jew  very much indeed if youll teach me sir replied oliver  master bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply that he burst into another laugh which laugh meeting the coffee he was drinking and carrying it down some wrong channel very nearly terminated in his premature suffocation  he is so jolly green said charley when he recovered as an apology to the company for his unpolite behaviour  the dodger said nothing but he smoothed olivers hair over his eyes and said hed know better by and by upon which the old gentleman observing olivers colour mounting changed the subject by asking whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning this made him wonder more and more for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they had both been there and oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very industrious  when the breakfast was cleared away the merry old gentlman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game which was performed in this way the merry old gentleman placing a snuffbox in one pocket of his trousers a notecase in the other and a watch in his waistcoat pocket with a guardchain round his neck and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt buttoned his coat tight round him and putting his spectaclecase and handkerchief in his pockets trotted up and down the room with a stick in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day  sometimes he stopped at the fireplace and sometimes at the door making believe that he was staring with all his might into shopwindows  at such times he would look constantly round him for fear of thieves and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn to see that he hadnt lost anything in such a very funny and natural manner that oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face  all this time the two boys followed him closely about getting out of his sight so nimbly every time he turned round that it was impossible to follow their motions at last the dodger trod upon his toes or ran upon his boot accidently while charley bates stumbled up against him behind and in that one moment they took from him with the most extraordinary rapidity snuffbox notecase watchguard chain shirtpin pockethandkerchief even the spectaclecase  if the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his pockets he cried out where it was and then the game began all over again  when this game had been played a great many times a couple of young ladies called to see the young gentleman one of whom was named bet and the other nancy  they wore a good deal of hair not very neatly turned up behind and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings they were not exactly pretty perhaps but they had a great deal of colour in their faces and looked quite stout and hearty  being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners oliver thought them very nice girls indeed  as there is no doubt they were  the visitors stopped a long time spirits were produced in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn at length charley bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof this it occurred to oliver must be french for going out for directly afterwards the dodger and charley and the two young ladies went away together having been kindly furnished by the amiable old jew with money to spend  there my dear said fagin thats a pleasant life isnt it they have gone out for the day  have they done work sir inquired oliver  yes said the jew that is unless they should unexpectedly come across any when they are out and they wont neglect it if they do my dear depend upon it  make em your models my dear make em your models tapping the fireshovel on the hearth to add force to his words do everything they bid you and take their advice in all mattersespecially the dodgers my dear hell be a great man himself and will make you one too if you take pattern by himis my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket my dear said the jew stopping short  yes sir said oliver  see if you can take it out without my feeling it as you saw them do when we were at play this morning  oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand as he had seen the dodger hold it and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the other  is it gone cried the jew  here it is sir said oliver showing it in his hand  youre a clever boy my dear said the playful old gentleman patting oliver on the head approvingly i never saw a sharper lad heres a shilling for you if you go on in this way youll be the greatest man of the time and now come here and ill show you how to take the marks out of the handkerchiefs  oliver wondered what picking the old gentlemans pocket in play had to do with his chances of being a great man  but thinking that the jew being so much his senior must know best he followed him quietly to the table and was soon deeply involved in his new study
