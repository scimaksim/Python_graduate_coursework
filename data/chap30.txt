chapter xxviii  looks after oliver and proceeds with his adventures  wolves tear your throats muttered sikes grinding his teeth i wish i was among some of you youd howl the hoarser for it  as sikes growled forth this imprecation with the most desperate ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of he rested the body of the wounded boy across his bended knee and turned his head for an instant to look back at his pursuers  there was little to be made out in the mist and darkness but the loud shouting of men vibrated through the air and the barking of the neighbouring dogs roused by the sound of the alarm bell resounded in every direction  stop you whitelivered hound cried the robber shouting after toby crackit who making the best use of his long legs was already ahead stop  the repetition of the word brought toby to a dead standstill for he was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistolshot and sikes was in no mood to be played with  bear a hand with the boy cried sikes beckoning furiously to his confederate  come back  toby made a show of returning but ventured in a low voice broken for want of breath to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly along  quicker cried sikes laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet and drawing a pistol from his pocket  dont play booty with me  at this moment the noise grew louder  sikes again looking round could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of the field in which he stood and that a couple of dogs were some paces in advance of them  its all up bill cried toby drop the kid and show em your heels  with this parting advice mr crackit preferring the chance of being shot by his friend to the certainty of being taken by his enemies fairly turned tail and darted off at full speed  sikes clenched his teeth took one look around threw over the prostrate form of oliver the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled ran along the front of the hedge as if to distract the attention of those behind from the spot where the boy lay paused for a second before another hedge which met it at right angles and whirling his pistol high into the air cleared it at a bound and was gone  ho ho there cried a tremulous voice in the rear pincher neptune  come here come here  the dogs who in common with their masters seemed to have no particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged readily answered to the command  three men who had by this time advanced some distance into the field stopped to take counsel together  my advice or leastways i should say my orders is said the fattest man of the party that we mediately go home again  i am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to mr giles said a shorter man who was by no means of a slim figure and who was very pale in the face and very polite as frightened men frequently are  i shouldnt wish to appear illmannered gentlemen said the third who had called the dogs back mr giles ought to know  certainly replied the shorter man and whatever mr giles says it isnt our place to contradict him  no no i know my sitiwation thank my stars i know my sitiwation  to tell the truth the little man did seem to know his situation and to know perfectly well that it was by no means a desirable one for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke  you are afraid brittles said mr giles  i ant said brittles  you are said giles  youre a falsehood mr giles said brittles  youre a lie brittles said mr giles  now these four retorts arose from mr giless taunt and mr giless taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of going home again imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment the third man brought the dispute to a close most philosophically  ill tell you what it is gentlemen said he were all afraid  speak for yourself sir said mr giles who was the palest of the party  so i do replied the man  its natural and proper to be afraid under such circumstances  i am  so am i said brittles only theres no call to tell a man he is so bounceably  these frank admissions softened mr giles who at once owned that he was afraid upon which they all three faced about and ran back again with the completest unanimity until mr giles who had the shortest wind of the party as was encumbered with a pitchfork most handsomely insisted on stopping to make an apology for his hastiness of speech  but its wonderful said mr giles when he had explained what a man will do when his blood is up  i should have committed murderi know i shouldif wed caught one of them rascals  as the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment and as their blood like his had all gone down again some speculation ensued upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament  i know what it was said mr giles it was the gate  i shouldnt wonder if it was exclaimed brittles catching at the idea  you may depend upon it said giles that that gate stopped the flow of the excitement  i felt all mine suddenly going away as i was climbing over it  by a remarkable coincidence the other two had been visited with the same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment  it was quite obvious therefore that it was the gate especially as there was no doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place because all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of its occurance  this dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse and who had been roused together with his two mongrel curs to join in the pursuit  mr giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old lady of the mansion brittles was a lad of allwork who having entered her service a mere child was treated as a promising young boy still though he was something past thirty  encouraging each other with such converse as this but keeping very close together notwithstanding and looking apprehensively round whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs the three men hurried back to a tree behind which they had left their lantern lest its light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire  catching up the light they made the best of their way home at a good round trot and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible the light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance like some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne  the air grew colder as day came slowly on and the mist rolled along the ground like a dense cloud of smoke  the grass was wet the pathways and low places were all mire and water the damp breath of an unwholesome wind went languidly by with a hollow moaning  still oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where sikes had left him  morning drew on apace  the air become more sharp and piercing as its first dull huethe death of night rather than the birth of dayglimmered faintly in the sky  the objects which had looked dim and terrible in the darkness grew more and more defined and gradually resolved into their familiar shapes  the rain came down thick and fast and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes  but oliver felt it not as it beat against him for he still lay stretched helpless and unconscious on his bed of clay  at length a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed and uttering it the boy awoke  his left arm rudely bandaged in a shawl hung heavy and useless at his side the bandage was saturated with blood  he was so weak that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture when he had done so he looked feebly round for help and groaned with pain  trembling in every joint from cold and exhaustion he made an effort to stand upright but shuddering from head to foot fell prostrate on the ground  after a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged oliver  urged by a creeping sickness at his heart which seemed to warn him that if he lay there he must surely die  got upon his feet and essayed to walk his head was dizzy and he staggered to and fro like a drunken man  but he kept up nevertheless and with his head drooping languidly on his breast went stumbling onward he knew not whither  and now hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his mind  he seemed to be still walking between sikes and crackit who were angrily disputingfor the very words they said sounded in his ears and when he caught his own attention as it were by making some violent effort to save himself from falling he found that he was talking to them then he was alone with sikes plodding on as on the previous day and as shadowy people passed them he felt the robbers grasp upon his wrist suddenly he started back at the report of firearms there rose into the air loud cries and shouts lights gleamed before his eyes all was noise and tumult as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away  through all these rapid visions there ran an undefined uneasy consciousness of pain which wearied and tormented him incessantly  thus he staggered on creeping almost mechanically between the bars of gates or through hedgegaps as they came in his way until he reached a road  here the rain began to fall so heavily that it roused him  he looked about and saw that at no great distance there was a house which perhaps he could reach  pitying his condition they might have compassion on him and if they did not it would be better he thought to die near human beings than in the lonely open fields  he summoned up all his strength for one last trial and bent his faltering steps towards it  as he drew nearer to this house a feeling come over him that he had seen it before  he remembered nothing of its details but the shape and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him  that garden wall  on the grass inside he had fallen on his knees last night and prayed the two mens mercy  it was the very house they had attempted to rob  oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place that for the instant he forgot the agony of his wound and thought only of flight  flight  he could scarcely stand  and if he were in full possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame whither could he fly  he pushed against the gardengate it was unlocked and swung open on its hinges  he tottered across the lawn climbed the steps knocked faintly at the door and his whole strength failing him sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico  it happened that about this time mr giles brittles and the tinker were recruiting themselves after the fatigues and terrors of the night with tea and sundries in the kitchen  not that it was mr giless habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability which while it gratified could not fail to remind them of his superior position in society  but death fires and burglary make all men equals so mr giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender leaning his left arm on the table while with his right he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of the robbery to which his bearers but especially the cook and housemaid who were of the party listened with breathless interest  it was about halfpast two said mr giles or i wouldnt swear that it mightnt have been a little nearer three when i woke up and turning round in my bed as it might be so here mr giles turned round in his chair and pulled the corner of the tablecloth over him to imitate bedclothes i fancied i heerd a noise  at this point of the narrative the cook turned pale and asked the housemaid to shut the door who asked brittles who asked the tinker who pretended not to hear  heerd a noise continued mr giles  i says at first this is illusion and was composing myself off to sleep when i heerd the noise again distinct  what sort of a noise asked the cook  a kind of a busting noise replied mr giles looking round him  more like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeggrater suggested brittles  it was when you heerd it sir rejoined mr giles but at this time it had a busting sound  i turned down the clothes continued giles rolling back the tablecloth sat up in bed and listened  the cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated lor and drew their chairs closer together  i heerd it now quite apparent resumed mr giles somebody i says is forcing of a door or window whats to be done ill call up that poor lad brittles and save him from being murdered in his bed or his throat i says may be cut from his right ear to his left without his ever knowing it  here all eyes were turned upon brittles who fixed his upon the speaker and stared at him with his mouth wide open and his face expressive of the most unmitigated horror  i tossed off the clothes said giles throwing away the tablecloth and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid got softly out of bed drew on a pair of  ladies present mr giles murmured the tinker  of shoes sir said giles turning upon him and laying great emphasis on the word seized the loaded pistol that always goes upstairs with the platebasket and walked on tiptoes to his room brittles i says when i had woke him dont be frightened  so you did observed brittles in a low voice  were dead men i think brittles i says continued giles but dont be frightened  was he frightened asked the cook  not a bit of it replied mr giles  he was as firmah pretty near as firm as i was  i should have died at once im sure if it had been me observed the housemaid  youre a woman retorted brittles plucking up a little  brittles is right said mr giles nodding his head approvingly from a woman nothing else was to be expected we being men took a dark lantern that was standing on brittles hob and groped our way downstairs in the pitch darkas it might be so  mr giles had risen from his seat and taken two steps with his eyes shut to accompany his description with appropriate action when he started violently in common with the rest of the company and hurried back to his chair  the cook and housemaid screamed  it was a knock said mr giles assuming perfect serenity open the door somebody  nobody moved  it seems a strange sort of a thing a knock coming at such a time in the morning said mr giles surveying the pale faces which surrounded him and looking very blank himself but the door must be opened  do you hear somebody  mr giles as he spoke looked at brittles but that young man being naturally modest probably considered himself nobody and so held that the inquiry could not have any application to him at all events he tendered no reply mr giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker but he had suddenly fallen asleep  the women were out of the question  if brittles would rather open the door in the presence of witnesses said mr giles after a short silence i am ready to make one  so am i said the tinker waking up as suddenly as he had fallen asleep  brittles capitulated on these terms and the party being somewhat reassured by the discovery made on throwing open the shutters that it was now broad day took their way upstairs with the dogs in front the two women who were afraid to stay below brought up the rear  by the advice of mr giles they all talked very loud to warn any evildisposed person outside that they were strong in numbers and by a masterstoke of policy originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman the dogs tails were well pinched in the hall to make them bark savagely  these precautions having been taken mr giles held on fast by the tinkers arm to prevent his running away as he pleasantly said and gave the word of command to open the door  brittles obeyed the group peeping timorously over each others shoulders beheld no more formidable object than poor little oliver twist speechless and exhausted who raised his heavy eyes and mutely solicited their compassion  a boy exclaimed mr giles valiantly pushing the tinker into the background  whats the matter with theehwhybrittleslook heredont you know  brittles who had got behind the door to open it no sooner saw oliver than he uttered a loud cry  mr giles seizing the boy by one leg and one arm fortunately not the broken limb lugged him straight into the hall and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof  here he is bawled giles calling in a state of great excitement up the staircase heres one of the thieves maam heres a thief miss wounded miss  i shot him miss and brittles held the light  in a lantern miss cried brittles applying one hand to the side of his mouth so that his voice might travel the better  the two womenservants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that mr giles had captured a robber and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring to restore oliver lest he should die before he could be hanged  in the midst of all this noise and commotion there was heard a sweet female voice which quelled it in an instant  giles whispered the voice from the stairhead  im here miss replied mr giles  dont be frightened miss i aint much injured  he didnt make a very desperate resistance miss i was soon too many for him  hush replied the young lady you frighten my aunt as much as the thieves did  is the poor creature much hurt  wounded desperate miss replied giles with indescribable complacency  he looks as if he was agoing miss bawled brittles in the same manner as before  wouldnt you like to come and look at him miss in case he should  hush pray theres a good man rejoined the lady  wait quietly only one instant while i speak to aunt  with a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice the speaker tripped away  she soon returned with the direction that the wounded person was to be carried carefully upstairs to mr giless room and that brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to chertsey  from which place he was to despatch with all speed a constable and doctor  but wont you take one look at him first miss asked mr giles with as much pride as if oliver were some bird of rare plumage that he had skilfully brought down  not one little peep miss  not now for the world replied the young lady  poor fellow oh treat him kindly giles for my sake  the old servant looked up at the speaker as she turned away with a glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child  then bending over oliver he helped to carry him upstairs with the care and solicitude of a woman
