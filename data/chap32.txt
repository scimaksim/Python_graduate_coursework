chapter xxx  relates what olivers new visitors thought of him  with many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in the aspect of the criminal the doctor drew the young ladys arm through one of his and offering his disengaged hand to mrs maylie led them with much ceremony and stateliness upstairs  now said the doctor in a whisper as he softly turned the handle of a bedroomdoor let us hear what you think of him  he has not been shaved very recently but he dont look at all ferocious notwithstanding  stop though  let me first see that he is in visiting order  stepping before them he looked into the room  motioning them to advance he closed the door when they had entered and gently drew back the curtains of the bed  upon it in lieu of the dogged blackvisaged ruffian they had expected to behold there lay a mere child  worn with pain and exhaustion and sunk into a deep sleep  his wounded arm bound and splintered up was crossed upon his breast his head reclined upon the other arm which was half hidden by his long hair as it streamed over the pillow  the honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand and looked on for a minute or so in silence  whilst he was watching the patient thus the younger lady glided softly past and seating herself in a chair by the bedside gathered olivers hair from his face  as she stooped over him her tears fell upon his forehead  the boy stirred and smiled in his sleep as though these marks of pity and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he had never known  thus a strain of gentle music or the rippling of water in a silent place or the odour of a flower or the mention of a familiar word will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never were in this life which vanish like a breath which some brief memory of a happier existence long gone by would seem to have awakened which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall  what can this mean exclaimed the elder lady  this poor child can never have been the pupil of robbers  vice said the surgeon replacing the curtain takes up her abode in many temples and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her  but at so early an age urged rose  my dear young lady rejoined the surgeon mournfully shaking his head crime like death is not confined to the old and withered alone  the youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims  but can youoh can you really believe that this delicate boy has been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society said rose  the surgeon shook his head in a manner which intimated that he feared it was very possible and observing that they might disturb the patient led the way into an adjoining apartment  but even if he has been wicked pursued rose think how young he is think that he may never have known a mothers love or the comfort of a home that illusage and blows or the want of bread may have driven him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt  aunt dear aunt for mercys sake think of this before you let them drag this sick child to a prison which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of amendment  oh as you love me and know that i have never felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection but that i might have done so and might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child have pity upon him before it is too late  my dear love said the elder lady as she folded the weeping girl to her bosom do you think i would harm a hair of his head  oh no replied rose eagerly  no surely said the old lady my days are drawing to their close and may mercy be shown to me as i show it to others what can i do to save him sir  let me think maam said the doctor let me think  mr losberne thrust his hands into his pockets and took several turns up and down the room often stopping and balancing himself on his toes and frowning frightfully  after various exclamations of ive got it now and no i havent and as many renewals of the walking and frowning he at length made a dead halt and spoke as follows  i think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully giles and that little boy brittles i can manage it  giles is a faithful fellow and an old servant i know but you can make it up to him in a thousand ways and reward him for being such a good shot besides  you dont object to that  unless there is some other way of preserving the child replied mrs maylie  there is no other said the doctor  no other take my word for it  then my aunt invests you with full power said rose smiling through her tears but pray dont be harder upon the poor fellows than is indispensably necessary  you seem to think retorted the doctor that everybody is disposed to be hardhearted today except yourself miss rose i only hope for the sake of the rising male sex generally that you may be found in as vulnerable and softhearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who appeals to your compassion and i wish i were a young fellow that i might avail myself on the spot of such a favourable opportunity for doing so as the present  you are as great a boy as poor brittles himself returned rose blushing  well said the doctor laughing heartily that is no very difficult matter  but to return to this boy  the great point of our agreement is yet to come  he will wake in an hour or so i dare say and although i have told that thickheaded constablefellow downstairs that he musnt be moved or spoken to on peril of his life i think we may converse with him without danger  now i make this stipulationthat i shall examine him in your presence and that if from what he says we judge and i can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason that he is a real and thorough bad one which is more than possible he shall be left to his fate without any farther interference on my part at all events  oh no aunt entreated rose  oh yes aunt said the doctor  is is a bargain  he cannot be hardened in vice said rose it is impossible  very good retorted the doctor then so much the more reason for acceding to my proposition  finally the treaty was entered into and the parties thereunto sat down to wait with some impatience until oliver should awake  the patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than mr losberne had led them to expect for hour after hour passed on and still oliver slumbered heavily  it was evening indeed before the kindhearted doctor brought them the intelligence that he was at length sufficiently restored to be spoken to  the boy was very ill he said and weak from the loss of blood but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to disclose something that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning which he should otherwise have done  the conference was a long one  oliver told them all his simple history and was often compelled to stop by pain and want of strength it was a solemn thing to hear in the darkened room the feeble voice of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men had brought upon him  oh if when we oppress and grind our fellowcreatures we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of human error which like dense and heavy clouds are rising slowly it is true but not less surely to heaven to pour their aftervengeance on our heads if we heard but one instant in imagination the deep testimony of dead mens voices which no power can stifle and no pride shut out where would be the injury and injustice the suffering misery cruelty and wrong that each days life brings with it  olivers pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night and loveliness and virtue watched him as he slept  he felt calm and happy and could have died without a murmur  the momentous interview was no sooner concluded and oliver composed to rest again than the doctor after wiping his eyes and condemning them for being weak all at once betook himself downstairs to open upon mr giles  and finding nobody about the parlours it occurred to him that he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen so into the kitchen he went  there were assembled in that lower house of the domestic parliament the womenservants mr brittles mr giles the tinker who had received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day in consideration of his services and the constable  the latter gentleman had a large staff a large head large features and large halfboots and he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of aleas indeed he had  the adventures of the previous night were still under discussion for mr giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind when the doctor entered mr brittles with a mug of ale in his hand was corroborating everything before his superior said it  sit still said the doctor waving his hand  thank you sir said mr giles  misses wished some ale to be given out sir and as i felt no ways inclined for my own little room sir and was disposed for company i am taking mine among em here  brittles headed a low murmur by which the ladies and gentlemen generally were understood to express the gratification they derived from mr giless condescension  mr giles looked round with a patronising air as much as to say that so long as they behaved properly he would never desert them  how is the patient tonight sir asked giles  soso returned the doctor  i am afraid you have got yourself into a scrape there mr giles  i hope you dont mean to say sir said mr giles trembling that hes going to die  if i thought it i should never be happy again  i wouldnt cut a boy off  no not even brittles here not for all the plate in the county sir  thats not the point said the doctor mysteriously  mr giles are you a protestant  yes sir i hope so faltered mr giles who had turned very pale  and what are you boy said the doctor turning sharply upon brittles  lord bless me sir replied brittles starting violently im the same as mr giles sir  then tell me this said the doctor both of you both of you are you going to take upon yourselves to swear that that boy upstairs is the boy that was put through the little window last night  out with it  come  we are prepared for you  the doctor who was universally considered one of the besttempered creatures on earth made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger that giles and brittles who were considerably muddled by ale and excitement stared at each other in a state of stupefaction  pay attention to the reply constable will you said the doctor shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner and tapping the bridge of his nose with it to bespeak the exercise of that worthys utmost acuteness something may come of this before long  the constable looked as wise as he could and took up his staff of office which had been reclining indolently in the chimneycorner  its a simple question of identity you will observe said the doctor  thats what it is sir replied the constable coughing with great violence for he had finished his ale in a hurry and some of it had gone the wrong way  heres the house broken into said the doctor and a couple of men catch one moments glimpse of a boy in the midst of gunpowder smoke and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness  heres a boy comes to that very same house next morning and because he happens to have his arm tied up these men lay violent hands upon himby doing which they place his life in great dangerand swear he is the thief  now the question is whether these men are justified by the fact if not in what situation do they place themselves  the constable nodded profoundly  he said if that wasnt law he would be glad to know what was  i ask you again thundered the doctor are you on your solemn oaths able to identify that boy  brittles looked doubtfully at mr giles mr giles looked doubtfully at brittles the constable put his hand behind his ear to catch the reply the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen the doctor glanced keenly round when a ring was heard at the gate and at the same moment the sound of wheels  its the runners cried brittles to all appearance much relieved  the what exclaimed the doctor aghast in his turn  the bow street officers sir replied brittles taking up a candle me and mr giles sent for em this morning  what cried the doctor  yes replied brittles i sent a message up by the coachman and i only wonder they werent here before sir  you did did you  then confound yourslow coaches down here thats all said the doctor walking away
