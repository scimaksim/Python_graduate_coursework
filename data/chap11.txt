chapter in this history  for many days oliver remained in the jews room picking the marks out of the pockethandkerchief of which a great number were brought home and sometimes taking part in the game already described which the two boys and the jew played regularly every morning at length he began to languish for fresh air and took many occasions of earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions  oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed by what he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentlemans character whenever the dodger or charley bates came home at night emptyhanded he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life by sending them supperless to bed on one occasion indeed he even went so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs but this was carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent  at length one morning oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly sought there had been no handkerchiefs to work upon for two or three days and the dinners had been rather meagre perhaps these were reasons for the old gentlemans giving his assent but whether they were or no he told oliver he might go and placed him under the joint guardianship of charley bates and his friend the dodger  the three boys sallied out the dodger with his coatsleeves tucked up and his hat cocked as usual master bates sauntering along with his hands in his pockets and oliver between them wondering where they were going and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in first  the pace at which they went was such a very lazy illlooking saunter that oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the old gentleman by not going to work at all the dodger had a vicious propensity too of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and tossing them down areas while charley bates exhibited some very loose notions concerning the rights of property by pilfering divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides and thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious that they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction these things looked so bad that oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of seeking his way back in the best way he could when his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel by a very mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the dodger  they were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square in clerkenwell which is yet called by some strange perversion of terms the green when the dodger made a sudden stop and laying his finger on his lip drew his companions back again with the greatest caution and circumspection  whats the matter demanded oliver  hush replied the dodger do you see that old cove at the bookstall  the old gentleman over the way said oliver yes i see him  hell do said the doger  a prime plant observed master charley bates  oliver looked from one to the other with the greatest surprise but he was not permitted to make any inquiries for the two boys walked stealthily across the road and slunk close behind the old gentleman towards whom his attention had been directed oliver walked a few paces after them and not knowing whether to advance or retire stood looking on in silent amazement  the old gentleman was a very respectablelooking personage with a powdered head and gold spectacles he was dressed in a bottlegreen coat with a black velvet collar wore white trousers and carried a smart bamboo cane under his arm he had taken up a book from the stall and there he stood reading away as hard as if he were in his elbowchair in his own study it is very possible that he fancied himself there indeed for it was plain from his abstraction that he saw not the bookstall nor the street nor the boys nor in short anything but the book itself which he was reading straight through turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page beginning at the top line of the next one and going regularly on with the greatest interest and eagerness  what was olivers horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off looking on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go to see the dodger plunge his hand into the old gentlemans pocket and draw from thence a handkerchief to see him hand the same to charley bates and finally to behold them both running away round the corner at full speed  in an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs and the watches and the jewels and the jew rushed upon the boys mind  he stood for a moment with the blood so tingling through all his veins from terror that he felt as if he were in a burning fire then confused and frightened he took to his heels and not knowing what he did made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground  this was all done in a minutes space in the very instant when oliver began to run the old gentleman putting his hand to his pocket and missing his handkerchief turned sharp round seeing the boy scudding away at such a rapid pace he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator and shouting stop thief with all his might made off after him book in hand  but the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hueandcry the dodger and master bates unwilling to attract public attention by running down the open street had merely retired into the very first doorway round the corner they no sooner heard the cry and saw oliver running than guessing exactly how the matter stood they issued forth with great promptitude and shouting stop thief too joined in the pursuit like good citizens  although oliver had been brought up by philosophers he was not theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that selfpreservation is the first law of nature if he had been perhaps he would have been prepared for this not being prepared however it alarmed him the more so away he went like the wind with the old gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him  stop thief stop thief there is a magic in the sound the tradesman leaves his counter and the carman his waggon the butcher throws down his tray the baker his basket the milkman his pail the errandboy his parcels the schoolboy his marbles the paviour his pickaxe the child his battledore away they run pellmell helterskelter slapdash tearing yelling screaming knocking down the passengers as they turn the corners rousing up the dogs and astonishing the fowls and streets squares and courts reecho with the sound  stop thief stop thief the cry is taken up by a hundred voices and the crowd accumulate at every turning away they fly splashing through the mud and rattling along the pavements up go the windows out run the people onward bear the mob a whole audience desert punch in the very thickest of the plot and joining the rushing throng swell the shout and lend fresh vigour to the cry stop thief stop thief  stop thief stop thief there is a passion for hunting something deeply implanted in the human breast  one wretched breathless child panting with exhaustion terror in his looks agony in his eyes large drops of perspiration streaming down his face strains every nerve to make head upon his pursuers and as they follow on his track and gain upon him every instant they hail his decreasing strength with joy stop thief  ay stop him for gods sake were it only in mercy  stopped at last  a clever blow  he is down upon the pavement and the crowd eagerly gather round him  each new comer jostling and struggling with the others to catch a glimpse  stand aside  give him a little air  nonsense he dont deserve it  wheres the gentleman  here his is coming down the street  make room there for the gentleman is this the boy sir  yes  oliver lay covered with mud and dust and bleeding from the mouth looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him when the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the foremost of the pursuers  yes said the gentleman i am afraid it is the boy  afraid murmured the crowd  thats a good un  poor fellow said the gentleman he has hurt himself  i did that sir said a great lubberly fellow stepping forward and preciously i cut my knuckle agin his mouth  i stopped him sir  the follow touched his hat with a grin expecting something for his pains but the old gentleman eyeing him with an expression of dislike look anxiously round as if he contemplated running away himself  which it is very possible he might have attempted to do and thus have afforded another chase had not a police officer who is generally the last person to arrive in such cases at that moment made his way through the crowd and seized oliver by the collar  come get up said the man roughly  it wasnt me indeed sir  indeed indeed it was two other boys said oliver clasping his hands passionately and looking round  they are here somewhere  oh no they aint said the officer  he meant this to be ironical but it was true besides for the dodger and charley bates had filed off down the first convenient court they came to  come get up  dont hurt him said the old gentleman compassionately  oh no i wont hurt him replied the officer tearing his jacket half off his back in proof thereof  come i know you it wont do  will you stand upon your legs you young devil  oliver who could hardly stand made a shift to raise himself on his feet and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacketcollar at a rapid pace  the gentleman walked on with them by the officers side and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat got a little ahead and stared back at oliver from time to time  the boys shouted in triumph and on they went
