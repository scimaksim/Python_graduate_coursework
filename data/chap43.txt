chapter xli  containing fresh discoveries and showing that suprises like misfortunes seldom come alone  her situation was indeed one of no common trial and difficulty while she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in which olivers history was enveloped she could not but hold sacred the confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed had reposed in her as a young and guileless girl  her words and manner had touched rose maylies heart and mingled with her love for her young charge and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope  they purposed remaining in london only three days prior to departing for some weeks to a distant part of the coast  it was now midnight of the first day  what course of action could she determine upon which could be adopted in eightandforty hours or how could she postpone the journey without exciting suspicion  mr losberne was with them and would be for the next two days but rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentlemans impetuosity and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which in the first explosion of his indignation he would regard the instrument of olivers recapture to trust him with the secret when her representations in the girls behalf could be seconded by no experienced person  these were all reasons for the greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to mrs maylie whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the worthy doctor on the subject  as to resorting to any legal adviser even if she had known how to do so it was scarcely to be thought of for the same reason  once the thought occurred to her of seeking assistance from harry but this awakened the recollection of their last parting and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back whenthe tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflectionhe might have by this time learnt to forget her and to be happier away  disturbed by these different reflections inclining now to one course and then to another and again recoiling from all as each successive consideration presented itself to her mind rose passed a sleepless and anxious night  after more communing with herself next day she arrived at the desperate conclusion of consulting harry  if it be painful to him she thought to come back here how painful it will be to me  but perhaps he will not come he may write or he may come himself and studiously abstain from meeting mehe did when he went away  i hardly thought he would but it was better for us both  and here rose dropped the pen and turned away as though the very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep  she had taken up the same pen and laid it down again fifty times and had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing the first word when oliver who had been walking in the streets with mr giles for a bodyguard entered the room in such breathless haste and violent agitation as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm  what makes you look so flurried asked rose advancing to meet him  i hardly know how i feel as if i should be choked replied the boy oh dear  to think that i should see him at last and you should be able to know that i have told you the truth  i never thought you had told us anything but the truth said rose soothing him  but what is thisof whom do you speak  i have seen the gentleman replied oliver scarcely able to articulate the gentleman who was so good to memr brownlow that we have so often talked about  where asked rose  getting out of a coach replied oliver shedding tears of delight and going into a house  i didnt speak to himi couldnt speak to him for he didnt see me and i trembled so that i was not able to go up to him  but giles asked for me whether he lived there and they said he did  look here said oliver opening a scrap of paper here it is heres where he livesim going there directly  oh dear me dear me  what shall i do when i come to see him and hear him speak again  with her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other incoherent exclamations of joy rose read the address which was craven street in the strand  she very soon determined upon turning the discovery to account  quick she said  tell them to fetch a hackneycoach and be ready to go with me  i will take you there directly without a minutes loss of time  i will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour and be ready as soon as you are  oliver needed no prompting to despatch and in little more than five minutes they were on their way to craven street  when they arrived there rose left oliver in the coach under pretence of preparing the old gentleman to receive him and sending up her card by the servant requested to see mr brownlow on very pressing business  the servant soon returned to beg that she would walk upstairs and following him into an upper room miss maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of benevolent appearance in a bottlegreen coat  at no great distance from whom was seated another old gentleman in nankeen breeches and gaiters who did not look particularly benevolent and who was sitting with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick and his chin propped thereupon  dear me said the gentleman in the bottlegreen coat hastily rising with great politeness i beg your pardon young ladyi imagined it was some importunate person whoi beg you will excuse me  be seated pray  mr brownlow i believe sir said rose glancing from the other gentleman to the one who had spoken  that is my name said the old gentleman  this is my friend mr grimwig  grimwig will you leave us for a few minutes  i believe interposed miss maylie that at this period of our interview i need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away if i am correctly informed he is cognizant of the business on which i wish to speak to you  mr brownlow inclined his head  mr grimwig who had made one very stiff bow and risen from his chair made another very stiff bow and dropped into it again  i shall surprise you very much i have no doubt said rose naturally embarrassed but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very dear young friend of mine and i am sure you will take an interest in hearing of him again  indeed said mr brownlow  oliver twist you knew him as replied rose  the words no sooner escaped her lips than mr grimwig who had been affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table upset it with a great crash and falling back in his chair discharged from his features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder and indulged in a prolonged and vacant stare then as if ashamed of having betrayed so much emotion he jerked himself as it were by a convulsion into his former attitude and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle which seemed at last not to be discharged on empty air but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach  mr browlow was no less surprised although his astonishment was not expressed in the same eccentric manner  he drew his chair nearer to miss maylies and said  do me the favour my dear young lady to leave entirely out of the question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak and of which nobody else knows anything and if you have it in your power to produce any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion i was once induced to entertain of that poor child in heavens name put me in possession of it  a bad one  ill eat my head if he is not a bad one growled mr grimwig speaking by some ventriloquial power without moving a muscle of his face  he is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart said rose colouring and that power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to many who have numbered his days six times over  im only sixtyone said mr grimwig with the same rigid face and as the devils in it if this oliver is not twelve years old at least i dont see the application of that remark  do not heed my friend miss maylie said mr brownlow he does not mean what he says  yes he does growled mr grimwig  no he does not said mr brownlow obviously rising in wrath as he spoke  hell eat his head if he doesnt growled mr grimwig  he would deserve to have it knocked off if he does said mr brownlow  and hed uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it responded mr grimwig knocking his stick upon the floor  having gone thus far the two old gentlemen severally took snuff and afterwards shook hands according to their invariable custom  now miss maylie said mr brownlow to return to the subject in which your humanity is so much interested  will you let me know what intelligence you have of this poor child  allowing me to promise that i exhausted every means in my power of discovering him and that since i have been absent from this country my first impression that he had imposed upon me and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob me has been considerably shaken  rose who had had time to collect her thoughts at once related in a few natural words all that had befallen oliver since he left mr brownlows house reserving nancys information for that gentlemans private ear and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow for some months past had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend  thank god said the old gentleman  this is great happiness to me great happiness  but you have not told me where he is now miss maylie  you must pardon my finding fault with youbut why not have brought him  he is waiting in a coach at the door replied rose  at this door cried the old gentleman  with which he hurried out of the room down the stairs up the coachsteps and into the coach without another word  when the roomdoor closed behind him mr grimwig lifted up his head and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table sitting in it all the time  after performing this evolution he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times and then stopping suddenly before rose kissed her without the slightest preface  hush he said as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual proceeding  dont be afraid  im old enough to be your grandfather youre a sweet girl  i like you  here they are  in fact as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat mr brownlow returned accompanied by oliver whom mr grimwig received very graciously and if the gratification of that moment had been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in olivers behalf rose maylie would have been well repaid  there is somebody else who should not be forgotten by the bye said mr brownlow ringing the bell  send mrs bedwin here if you please  the old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch and dropping a curtsey at the door waited for orders  why you get blinder every day bedwin said mr brownlow rather testily  well that i do sir replied the old lady  peoples eyes at my time of life dont improve with age sir  i could have told you that rejoined mr brownlow but put on your glasses and see if you cant find out what you were wanted for will you  the old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles but olivers patience was not proof against this new trial and yielding to his first impulse he sprang into her arms  god be good to me cried the old lady embracing him it is my innocent boy  my dear old nurse cried oliver  he would come backi knew he would said the old lady holding him in her arms  how well he looks and how like a gentlemans son he is dressed again  where have you been this long long while  ah the same sweet face but not so pale the same soft eye but not so sad  i have never forgotten them or his quiet smile but have seen them every day side by side with those of my own dear children dead and gone since i was a lightsome young creature  running on thus and now holding oliver from her to mark how he had grown now clasping him to her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair the good soul laughed and wept upon his neck by turns  leaving her and oliver to compare notes at leisure mr brownlow led the way into another room and there heard from rose a full narration of her interview with nancy which occasioned him no little surprise and perplexity  rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her friend mr losberne in the first instance  the old gentleman considered that she had acted prudently and readily undertook to hold solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself  to afford him an early opportunity for the execution of this design it was arranged that he should call at the hotel at eight oclock that evening and that in the meantime mrs maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had occurred  these preliminaries adjusted rose and oliver returned home  rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctors wrath nancys history was no sooner unfolded to him than he poured forth a shower of mingled threats and execrations threatened to make her the first victim of the combined ingenuity of messrs blathers and duff and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the assistance of those worthies  and doubtless he would in this first outbreak have carried the intention into effect without a moments consideration of the consequences if he had not been restrained in part by corresponding violence on the side of mr brownlow who was himself of an irascible temperament and party by such arguments and representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose  then what the devil is to be done said the impetuous doctor when they had rejoined the two ladies  are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these vagabonds male and female and beg them to accept a hundred pounds or so apiece as a trifling mark of our esteem and some slight acknowledgment of their kindness to oliver  not exactly that rejoined mr brownlow laughing but we must proceed gently and with great care  gentleness and care exclaimed the doctor  id send them one and all to  never mind where interposed mr brownlow  but reflect whether sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view  what object asked the doctor  simply the discovery of olivers parentage and regaining for him the inheritance of which if this story be true he has been fraudulently deprived  ah said mr losberne cooling himself with his pockethandkerchief i almost forgot that  you see pursued mr brownlow placing this poor girl entirely out of the question and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety what good should we bring about  hanging a few of them at least in all probability suggested the doctor and transporting the rest  very good replied mr brownlow smiling but no doubt they will bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time and if we step in to forestall them it seems to me that we shall be performing a very quixotic act in direct opposition to our own interestor at least to olivers which is the same thing  how inquired the doctor  thus  it is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting to the bottom of this mystery unless we can bring this man monks upon his knees  that can only be done by stratagem and by catching him when he is not surrounded by these people  for suppose he were apprehended we have no proof against him  he is not even so far as we know or as the facts appear to us concerned with the gang in any of their robberies if he were not discharged it is very unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as well for our purposes be deaf dumb blind and an idiot  then said the doctor impetuously i put it to you again whether you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered binding a promise made with the best and kindest intentions but really  do not discuss the point my dear young lady pray said mr brownlow interrupting rose as she was about to speak the promise shall be kept  i dont think it will in the slightest degree interfere with our proceedings  but before we can resolve upon any precise course of action it will be necessary to see the girl to ascertain from her whether she will point out this monks on the understanding that he is to be dealt with by us and not by the law or if she will not or cannot do that to procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his person as will enable us to identify him  she cannot be seen until next sunday night this is tuesday  i would suggest that in the meantime we remain perfectly quiet and keep these matters secret even from oliver himself  although mr losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a delay of five whole days he was fain to admit that no better course occurred to him just then and as both rose and mrs maylie sided very strongly with mr brownlow that gentlemans proposition was carried unanimously  i should like he said to call in the aid of my friend grimwig  he is a strange creature but a shrewd one and might prove of material assistance to us i should say that he was bred a lawyer and quitted the bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course in twenty years though whether that is recommendation or not you must determine for yourselves  i have no objection to your calling in your friend if i may call in mine said the doctor  we must put it to the vote replied mr brownlow who may he be  that ladys son and this young ladysvery old friend said the doctor motioning towards mrs maylie and concluding with an expressive glance at her niece  rose blushed deeply but she did not make any audible objection to this motion possibly she felt in a hopeless minority and harry maylie and mr grimwig were accordingly added to the committee  we stay in town of course said mrs maylie while there remains the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success  i will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we are all so deeply interested and i am content to remain here if it be for twelve months so long as you assure me that any hope remains  good rejoined mr brownlow  and as i see on the faces about me a disposition to inquire how it happened that i was not in the way to corroborate olivers tale and had so suddenly left the kingdom let me stipulate that i shall be asked no questions until such time as i may deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story  believe me i make this request with good reason for i might otherwise excite hopes destined never to be realised and only increase difficulties and disappointments already quite numerous enough  come  supper has been announced and young oliver who is all alone in the next room will have begun to think by this time that we have wearied of his company and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world  with these words the old gentleman gave his hand to mrs maylie and escorted her into the supperroom  mr losberne followed leading rose and the council was for the present effectually broken up
