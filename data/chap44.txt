chapter xlii  an old acquaintance of olivers exhibiting decided marks of genius becomes a public character in the metropolis  upon the night when nancy having lulled mr sikes to sleep hurried on her selfimposed mission to rose maylie there advanced towards london by the great north road two persons upon whom it is expedient that this history should bestow some attention  they were a man and woman or perhaps they would be better described as a male and female  for the former was one of those longlimbed knockkneed shambling bony people to whom it is difficult to assign any precise agelooking as they do when they are yet boys like undergrown men and when they are almost men like overgrown boys  the woman was young but of a robust and hardy make as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back her companion was not encumbered with much luggage as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief and apparently light enough  this circumstance added to the length of his legs which were of unusual extent enabled him with much ease to keep some halfdozen paces in advance of his companion to whom he occasionally turned with an impatient jerk of the head  as if reproaching her tardiness and urging her to greater exertion  thus they had toiled along the dusty road taking little heed of any object within sight save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage for the mailcoaches which were whirling out of town until they passed through highgate archway when the foremost traveller stopped and called impatiently to his companion  come on cant yer  what a lazybones yer are charlotte  its a heavy load i can tell you said the female coming up almost breathless with fatigue  heavy  what are yer talking about  what are yer made for rejoined the male traveller changing his own little bundle as he spoke to the other shoulder  oh there yer are resting again well if yer aint enough to tire anybodys patience out i dont know what is  is it much farther asked the woman resting herself against a bank and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face  much farther  yer as good as there said the longlegged tramper pointing out before him  look there  those are the lights of london  theyre a good two mile off at least said the woman despondingly  never mind whether theyre two mile off or twenty said noah claypole for he it was but get up and come on or ill kick yer and so i give yer notice  as noahs red nose grew redder with anger and as he crossed the road while speaking as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution the woman rose without any further remark and trudged onward by his side  where do you mean to stop for the night noah she asked after they had walked a few hundred yards  how should i know replied noah whose temper had been considerably impaired by walking  near i hope said charlotte  no not near replied mr claypole  there  not near so dont think it  why not  when i tell yer that i dont mean to do a thing thats enough without any why or because either replied mr claypole with dignity  well you neednt be so cross said his companion  a pretty thing it would be wouldnt it to go and stop at the very first publichouse outside the town so that sowerberry if he come up after us might poke in his old nose and have us taken back in a cart with handcuffs on said mr claypole in a jeering tone  no  i shall go and lose myself among the narrowest streets i can find and not stop till we come to the very outofthewayest house i can set eyes on cod yer may thanks yer stars ive got a head for if we hadnt gone at first the wrong road a purpose and come back across country yerd have been locked up hard and fast a week ago my lady  and serve yer right for being a fool  i know i aint as cunning as you are replied charlotte but dont put all the blame on me and say i should have been locked up  you would have been if i had been any way  yer took the money from the till yer know yer did said mr claypole  i took it for you noah dear rejoined charlotte  did i keep it asked mr claypole  no you trusted in me and let me carry it like a dear and so you are said the lady chucking him under the chin and drawing her arm through his  this was indeed the case but as it was not mr claypoles habit to repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody it should be observed in justice to that gentleman that he had trusted charlotte to this extent in order that if they were pursued the money might be found on her  which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any theft and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape  of course he entered at this juncture into no explanation of his motives and they walked on very lovingly together  in pursuance of this cautious plan mr claypole went on without halting until he arrived at the angel at islington where he wisely judged from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles that london began in earnest  just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets and consequently the most to be avoided he crossed into saint johns road and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways which lying between grays inn lane and smithfield render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the midst of london  through these streets noah claypole walked dragging charlotte after him now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external character of some small publichouse now jogging on again as some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose  at length he stopped in front of one more humble in appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen and having crossed over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement graciously announced his intention of putting up there for the night  so give us the bundle said noah unstrapping it from the womans shoulders and slinging it over his own and dont yer speak except when yer spoke to  whats the name of the housethrthree what  cripples said charlotte  three cripples repeated noah and a very good sign too  now then keep close at my heels and come along  with these injunctions he pushed the rattling door with his shoulder and entered the house followed by his companion  there was nobody in the bar but a young jew who with his two elbows on the counter was reading a dirty newspaper he stared very hard at noah and noah stared very hard at him  if noah had been attired in his charityboys dress there might have been some reason for the jew opening his eyes so wide but as he had discarded the coat and badge and wore a short smockfrock over his leathers there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention in a publichouse  is this the three cripples asked noah  that is the dabe of this ouse replied the jew  a gentleman we met on the road coming up from the country recommended us here said noah nudging charlotte perhaps to call her attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect and perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise  we want to sleep here tonight  ib dot certaid you cad said barney who was the attendant sprite but ill idquire  show us the tap and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while yer inquiring will yer said noah  barney complied by ushering them into a small backroom and setting the required viands before them having done which he informed the travellers that they could be lodged that night and left the amiable couple to their refreshment  now this backroom was immediately behind the bar and some steps lower so that any person connected with the house undrawing a small curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the lastnamed apartment about five feet from its flooring could not only look down upon any guests in the backroom without any great hazard of being observed the glass being in a dark angle of the wall between which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself but could by applying his ear to the partition ascertain with tolerable distinctness their subject of conversation  the landlord of the house had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes and barney had only just returned from making the communication above related when fagin in the course of his evenings business came into the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils  hush said barney  stradegers id the next roob  strangers repeated the old man in a whisper  ah  ad rub uds too added barney  frob the cuttry but subthig in your way or ib bistaked  fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest  mounting a stool he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass from which secret post he could see mr claypole taking cold beef from the dish and porter from the pot and administering homeopathic doses of both to charlotte who sat patiently by eating and drinking at his pleasure  aha he whispered looking round to barney i like that fellows looks  hed be of use to us he knows how to train the girl already dont make as much noise as a mouse my dear and let me hear em talklet me hear em  he again applied his eye to the glass and turning his ear to the partition listened attentively  with a subtle and eager look upon his face that might have appertained to some old goblin  so i mean to be a gentleman said mr claypole kicking out his legs and continuing a conversation the commencement of which fagin had arrived too late to hear no more jolly old coffins charlotte but a gentlemans life for me  and if yer like yer shall be a lady  i should like that well enough dear replied charlotte but tills aint to be emptied every day and people to get clear off after it  tills be blowed said mr claypole theres more things besides tills to be emptied  what do you mean asked his companion  pockets womens ridicules houses mailcoaches banks said mr claypole rising with the porter  but you cant do all that dear said charlotte  i shall look out to get into company with them as can replied noah theyll be able to make us useful some way or another why you yourself are worth fifty women i never see such a precious sly and deceitful creetur as yer can be when i let yer  lor how nice it is to hear yer say so exclaimed charlotte imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face  there thatll do  dont yer be too affectionate in case im cross with yer said noah disengaging himself with great gravity  i should like to be the captain of some band and have the whopping of em and follering em about unbeknown to themselves  that would suit me if there was good profit and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort i say it would be cheap at that twentypound note youve gotespecially as we dont very well know how to get rid of it ourselves  after expressing this opinion mr claypole looked into the porterpot with an aspect of deep wisdom and having well shaken its contents nodded condescendingly to charlotte and took a draught wherewith he appeared greatly refreshed  he was meditating another when the sudden opening of the door and the appearance of a stranger interrupted him  the stranger was mr fagin  and very amiable he looked and a very low bow he made as he advanced and setting himself down at the nearest table ordered something to drink of the grinning barney  a pleasant night sir but cool for the time of year said fagin rubbing his hands  from the country i see sir  how do yer see that asked noah claypole  we have not so much dust as that in london replied fagin pointing from noahs shoes to those of his companion and from them to the two bundles  yer a sharp feller said noah  ha ha only hear that charlotte  why one need be sharp in this town my dear replied the jew sinking his voice to a confidential whisper and thats the truth  fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his right forefingera gesture which noah attempted to imitate though not with complete success in consequence of his own nose not being large enough for the purpose  however mr fagin seemed to interpret the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion and put about the liquor which barney reappeared with in a very friendly manner  good stuff that observed mr claypole smacking his lips  dear said fagin  a man need be always emptying a till or a pocket or a womans reticule or a house or a mailcoach or a bank if he drinks it regularly  mr claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he fell back in his chair and looked from the jew to charlotte with a countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror  dont mind me my dear said fagin drawing his chair closer ha ha it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance it was very lucky it was only me  i didnt take it stammered noah no longer stretching out his legs like an independent gentleman but coiling them up as well as he could under his chair it was all her doing yerve got it now charlotte yer know yer have  no matter whos got it or who did it my dear replied fagin glancing nevertheless with a hawks eye at the girl and the two bundles  im in that way myself and i like you for it  in what way asked mr claypole a little recovering  in that way of business rejoined fagin and so are the people of the house  youve hit the right nail upon the head and are as safe here as you could be  there is not a safer place in all this town than is the cripples that is when i like to make it so  and i have taken a fancy to you and the young woman so ive said the word and you may make your minds easy  noah claypoles mind might have been at ease after this assurance but his body certainly was not for he shuffled and writhed about into various uncouth positions  eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and suspicion  ill tell you more said fagin after he had reassured the girl by dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements i have got a friend that i think can gratify your darling wish and put you in the right way where you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you best at first and be taught all the others  yer speak as if yer were in earnest replied noah  what advantage would it be to me to be anything else inquired fagin shrugging his shoulders  here  let me have a word with you outside  theres no occasion to trouble ourselves to move said noah getting his legs by gradual degrees abroad again shell take the luggage upstairs the while  charlotte see to them bundles  this mandate which had been delivered with great majesty was obeyed without the slightest demur and charlotte made the best of her way off with the packages while noah held the door open and watched her out  shes kept tolerably well under aint she he asked as he resumed his seat  in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal  quite perfect rejoined fagin clapping him on the shoulder youre a genius my dear  why i suppose if i wasnt i shouldnt be here replied noah but i say shell be back if yer lose time  now what do you think said fagin  if you was to like my friend could you do better than join him  is he in a good way of business thats where it is responded noah winking one of his little eyes  the top of the tree employs a power of hands has the very best society in the profession  regular townmaders asked mr claypole  not a countryman among em and i dont think hed take you even on my recommendation if he didnt run rather short of assistants just now replied fagin  should i have to hand over said noah slapping his breechespocket  it couldnt possibly be done without replied fagin in a most decided manner  twenty pound thoughits a lot of money  not when its in a note you cant get rid of retorted fagin number and date taken i suppose  payment stopped at the bank ah  its not worth much to him  itll have to go abroad and he couldnt sell it for a great deal in the market  when could i see him asked noah doubtfully  tomorrow morning  where  here  um said noah  whats the wages  live like a gentlemanboard and lodging pipes and spirits freehalf of all you earn and half of all the young woman earns replied mr fagin  whether noah claypole whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive would have acceded even to these glowing terms had he been a perfectly free agent is very doubtful but as he recollected that in the event of his refusal it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately and more unlikely things had come to pass he gradually relented and said he thought that would suit him  but yer see observed noah as she will be able to do a good deal i should like to take something very light  a little fancy work suggested fagin  ah something of that sort replied noah  what do you think would suit me now  something not too trying for the strength and not very dangerous you know  thats the sort of thing  i heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others my dear said fagin  my friend wants somebody who would do that well very much  why i did mention that and i shouldnt mind turning my hand to it sometimes rejoined mr claypole slowly but it wouldnt pay by itself you know  thats true observed the jew ruminating or pretending to ruminate no it might not  what do you think then asked noah anxiously regarding him something in the sneaking way where it was pretty sure work and not much more risk than being at home  what do you think of the old ladies asked fagin theres a good deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels and running round the corner  dont they holler out a good deal and scratch sometimes asked noah shaking his head  i dont think that would answer my purpose  aint there any other line open  stop said fagin laying his hand on noahs knee  the kinchin lay  whats that demanded mr claypole  the kinchins my dear said fagin is the young children thats sent on errands by their mothers with sixpences and shillings and the lay is just to take their money awaytheyve always got it ready in their handsthen knock em into the kennel and walk off very slow as if there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt itself  ha ha ha  ha ha roared mr claypole kicking up his legs in an ecstasy lord thats the very thing  to be sure it is replied fagin and you can have a few good beats chalked out in camden town and battle bridge and neighborhoods like that where theyre always going errands and you can upset as many kinchins as you want any hour in the day ha ha ha  with this fagin poked mr claypole in the side and they joined in a burst of laughter both long and loud  well thats all right said noah when he had recovered himself and charlotte had returned  what time tomorrow shall we say  will ten do asked fagin adding as mr claypole nodded assent what name shall i tell my good friend  mr bolter replied noah who had prepared himself for such emergency  mr morris bolter  this is mrs bolter  mrs bolters humble servant said fagin bowing with grotesque politeness  i hope i shall know her better very shortly  do you hear the gentleman charlotte thundered mr claypole  yes noah dear replied mrs bolter extending her hand  she calls me noah as a sort of fond way of talking said mr morris bolter late claypole turning to fagin  you understand  oh yes i understandperfectly replied fagin telling the truth for once  goodnight  goodnight  with many adieus and good wishes mr fagin went his way noah claypole bespeaking his good ladys attention proceeded to enlighten her relative to the arrangement he had made with all that haughtiness and air of superiority becoming not only a member of the sterner sex but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the kinchin lay in london and its vicinity
