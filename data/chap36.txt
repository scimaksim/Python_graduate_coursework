chapter xxxiv  contains some introductory particulars relative to a young gentleman who now arrives upon the scene and a new adventure which happened to oliver  it was almost too much happiness to bear  oliver felt stunned and stupefied by the unexpected intelligence he could not weep or speak or rest  he had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed until after a long ramble in the quiet evening air a burst of tears came to his relief and he seemed to awaken all at once to a full sense of the joyful change that had occurred and the almost insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast  the night was fast closing in when he returned homeward  laden with flowers which he had culled with peculiar care for the adornment of the sick chamber  as he walked briskly along the road he heard behind him the noise of some vehicle approaching at a furious pace  looking round he saw that it was a postchaise driven at great speed and as the horses were galloping and the road was narrow he stood leaning against a gate until it should have passed him  as it dashed on oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap whose face seemed familiar to him although his view was so brief that he could not identify the person  in another second or two the nightcap was thrust out of the chaisewindow and a stentorian voice bellowed to the driver to stop  which he did as soon as he could pull up his horses  then the nightcap once again appeared and the same voice called oliver by his name  here cried the voice  oliver whats the news  miss rose master oliver  is is you giles cried oliver running up to the chaisedoor  giles popped out his nightcap again preparatory to making some reply when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the other corner of the chaise and who eagerly demanded what was the news  in a word cried the gentleman better or worse  bettermuch better replied oliver hastily  thank heaven exclaimed the gentleman  you are sure  quite sir replied oliver  the change took place only a few hours ago and mr losberne says that all danger is at an end  the gentleman said not another word but opening the chaisedoor leaped out and taking oliver hurriedly by the arm led him aside  you are quite certain  there is no possibility of any mistake on your part my boy is there demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice do not deceive me by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled  i would not for the world sir replied oliver  indeed you may believe me  mr losbernes words were that she would live to bless us all for many years to come  i heard him say so  the tears stood in olivers eyes as he recalled the scene which was the beginning of so much happiness and the gentleman turned his face away and remained silent for some minutes  oliver thought he heard him sob more than once but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remarkfor he could well guess what his feelings wereand so stood apart feigning to be occupied with his nosegay  all this time mr giles with the white nightcap on had been sitting on the steps of the chaise supporting an elbow on each knee and wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pockethandkerchief dotted with white spots  that the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion was abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young gentleman when he turned round and addressed him  i think you had better go on to my mothers in the chaise giles said he  i would rather walk slowly on so as to gain a little time before i see her  you can say i am coming  i beg your pardon mr harry said giles  giving a final polish to his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief but if you would leave the postboy to say that i should be very much obliged to you  it wouldnt be proper for the maids to see me in this state sir i should never have any more authority with them if they did  well rejoined harry maylie smiling you can do as you like let him go on with the luggage if you wish it and do you follow with us only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering or we shall be taken for madmen  mr giles reminded of his unbecoming costume snatched off and pocketed his nightcap and substituted a hat of grave and sober shape which he took out of the chaise  this done the postboy drove off giles mr maylie and oliver followed at their leisure  as they walked along oliver glanced from time to time with much interest and curiosity at the new comer  he seemed about fiveandtwenty years of age and was of the middle height his countenance was frank and handsome and his demeanor easy and prepossessing  notwithstanding the difference between youth and age he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady that oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship if he had not already spoken of her as his mother  mrs maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the cottage  the meeting did not take place without great emotion on both sides  mother whispered the young man why did you not write before  i did replied mrs maylie but on reflection i determined to keep back the letter until i had heard mr losbernes opinion  but why said the young man why run the chance of that occurring which so nearly happened  if rose hadi cannot utter that word nowif this illness had terminated differently how could you ever have forgiven yourself  how could i ever have know happiness again  if that had been the case harry said mrs maylie i fear your happiness would have been effectually blighted and that your arrival here a day sooner or a day later would have been of very very little import  and who can wonder if it be so mother rejoined the young man or why should i say ifit isit isyou know it motheryou must know it  i know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can offer said mrs maylie i know that the devotion and affection of her nature require no ordinary return but one that shall be deep and lasting  if i did not feel this and know besides that a changed behaviour in one she loved would break her heart i should not feel my task so difficult of performance or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom when i take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty  this is unkind mother said harry  do you still suppose that i am a boy ignorant of my own mind and mistaking the impulses of my own soul  i think my dear son returned mrs maylie laying her hand upon his shoulder that youth has many generous impulses which do not last and that among them are some which being gratified become only the more fleeting  above all i think said the lady fixing her eyes on her sons face that if an enthusiastic ardent and ambitious man marry a wife on whose name there is a stain which though it originate in no fault of hers may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her and upon his children also and in exact proportion to his success in the world be cast in his teeth and made the subject of sneers against him  he may no matter how generous and good his nature one day repent of the connection he formed in early life  and she may have the pain of knowing that he does so  mother said the young man impatiently he would be a selfish brute unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe who acted thus  you think so now harry replied his mother  and ever will said the young man  the mental agony i have suffered during the last two days wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion which as you well know is not one of yesterday nor one i have lightly formed  on rose sweet gentle girl my heart is set as firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman  i have no thought no view no hope in life beyond her and if you oppose me in this great stake you take my peace and happiness in your hands and cast them to the wind  mother think better of this and of me and do not disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little  harry said mrs maylie it is because i think so much of warm and sensitive hearts that i would spare them from being wounded but we have said enough and more than enough on this matter just now  let it rest with rose then interposed harry  you will not press these overstrained opinions of yours so far as to throw any obstacle in my way  i will not rejoined mrs maylie but i would have you consider  i have considered was the impatient reply mother i have considered years and years  i have considered ever since i have been capable of serious reflection  my feelings remain unchanged as they ever will and why should i suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent which can be productive of no earthly good  no  before i leave this place rose shall hear me  she shall said mrs maylie  there is something in your manner which would almost imply that she will hear me coldly mother said the young man  not coldly rejoined the old lady far from it  how then urged the young man  she has formed no other attachment  no indeed replied his mother you have or i mistake too strong a hold on her affections already  what i would say resumed the old lady stopping her son as he was about to speak is this  before you stake your all on this chance before you suffer yourself to be carried to the highest point of hope reflect for a few moments my dear child on roses history and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may have on her decision  devoted as she is to us with all the intensity of her noble mind and with that perfect sacrifice of self which in all matters great or trifling has always been her characteristic  what do you mean  that i leave you to discover replied mrs maylie  i must go back to her  god bless you  i shall see you again tonight said the young man eagerly  by and by replied the lady when i leave rose  you will tell her i am here said harry  of course replied mrs maylie  and say how anxious i have been and how much i have suffered and how i long to see her  you will not refuse to do this mother  no said the old lady i will tell her all  and pressing her sons hand affectionately she hastened from the room  mr losberne and oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while this hurried conversation was proceeding  the former now held out his hand to harry maylie and hearty salutations were exchanged between them  the doctor then communicated in reply to multifarious questions from his young friend a precise account of his patients situation which was quite as consolatory and full of promise as olivers statement had encouraged him to hope and to the whole of which mr giles who affected to be busy about the luggage listened with greedy ears  have you shot anything particular lately giles inquired the doctor when he had concluded  nothing particular sir replied mr giles colouring up to the eyes  nor catching any thieves nor identifying any housebreakers said the doctor  none at all sir replied mr giles with much gravity  well said the doctor i am sorry to hear it because you do that sort of thing admirably  pray how is brittles  the boy is very well sir said mr giles recovering his usual tone of patronage and sends his respectful duty sir  thats well said the doctor  seeing you here reminds me mr giles that on the day before that on which i was called away so hurriedly i executed at the request of your good mistress a small commission in your favour  just step into this corner a moment will you  mr giles walked into the corner with much importance and some wonder and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor on the termination of which he made a great many bows and retired with steps of unusual stateliness  the subject matter of this conference was not disclosed in the parlour but the kitchen was speedily enlightened concerning it for mr giles walked straight thither and having called for a mug of ale announced with an air of majesty which was highly effective that it had pleased his mistress in consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery to deposit in the local savingsbank the sum of fiveandtwenty pounds for his sole use and benefit  at this the two womenservants lifted up their hands and eyes and supposed that mr giles pulling out his shirtfrill replied no no and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors he would thank them to tell him so  and then he made a great many other remarks no less illustrative of his humility which were received with equal favour and applause and were withal as original and as much to the purpose as the remarks of great men commonly are  above stairs the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away for the doctor was in high spirits and however fatigued or thoughtful harry maylie might have been at first he was not proof against the worthy gentlemans good humour which displayed itself in a great variety of sallies and professional recollections and an abundance of small jokes which struck oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard and caused him to laugh proportionately to the evident satisfaction of the doctor who laughed immoderately at himself and made harry laugh almost as heartily by the very force of sympathy so they were as pleasant a party as under the circumstances they could well have been and it was late before they retired with light and thankful hearts to take that rest of which after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone they stood much in need  oliver rose next morning in better heart and went about his usual occupations with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days  the birds were once more hung out to sing in their old places and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found were once more gathered to gladden rose with their beauty the melancholy which had seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang for days past over every object beautiful as all were was dispelled by magic  the dew seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves the air to rustle among them with a sweeter music and the sky itself to look more blue and bright such is the influence which the condition of our own thoughts exercise even over the appearance of external objects  men who look on nature and their fellowmen and cry that all is dark and gloomy are in the right but the sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts  the real hues are delicate and need a clearer vision  it is worthy of remark and oliver did not fail to note it at the time that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone harry maylie after the very first morning when he met oliver coming laden home was seized with such a passion for flowers and displayed such a taste in their arrangement as left his young companion far behind  if oliver were behindhand in these respects he knew where the best were to be found and morning after morning they scoured the country together and brought home the fairest that blossomed  the window of the young ladys chamber was opened now for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in and revive her with its freshness but there always stood in water just inside the lattice one particular little bunch which was made up with great care every morning  oliver could not help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away although the little vase was regularly replenished nor could he help observing that whenever the doctor came into the garden he invariably cast his eyes up to that particular corner and nodded his head most expressively as he set forth on his mornings walk  pending these observations the days were flying by and rose was rapidly recovering  nor did olivers time hang heavy on his hands although the young lady had not yet left her chamber and there were no evening walks save now and then for a short distance with mrs maylie he applied himself with redoubled assiduity to the instructions of the whiteheaded old gentleman and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even himself  it was while he was engaged in this pursuit that he was greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence  the little room in which he was accustomed to sit when busy at his books was on the groundfloor at the back of the house  it was quite a cottageroom with a latticewindow around which were clusters of jessamine and honeysuckle that crept over the casement and filled the place with their delicious perfume  it looked into a garden whence a wicketgate opened into a small paddock all beyond was fine meadowland and wood  there was no other dwelling near in that direction and the prospect it commanded was very extensive  one beautiful evening when the first shades of twilight were beginning to settle upon the earth oliver sat at this window intent upon his books  he had been poring over them for some time and as the day had been uncommonly sultry and he had exerted himself a great deal it is no disparagement to the authors whoever they may have been to say that gradually and by slow degrees he fell asleep  there is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes which while it holds the body prisoner does not free the mind from a sense of things about it and enable it to ramble at its pleasure  so far as an overpowering heaviness a prostration of strength and an utter inability to control our thoughts or power of motion can be called sleep this is it and yet we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us and if we dream at such a time words which are really spoken or sounds which really exist at the moment accommodate themselves with surprising readiness to our visions until reality and imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to separate the two  nor is this the most striking phenomenon incidental to such a state  it is an undoubted fact that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead yet our sleeping thoughts and the visionary scenes that pass before us will be influenced and materially influenced by the mere silent presence of some external object which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes  and of whose vicinity we have had no waking consciousness  oliver knew perfectly well that he was in his own little room that his books were lying on the table before him that the sweet air was stirring among the creeping plants outside  and yet he was asleep suddenly the scene changed the air became close and confined and he thought with a glow of terror that he was in the jews house again there sat the hideous old man in his accustomed corner pointing at him and whispering to another man with his face averted who sat beside him  hush my dear he thought he heard the jew say it is he sure enough  come away  he the other man seemed to answer could i mistake him think you if a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape and he stood amongst them there is something that would tell me how to point him out  if you buried him fifty feet deep and took me across his grave i fancy i should know if there wasnt a mark above it that he lay buried there  the man seemed to say this with such dreadful hatred that oliver awoke with the fear and started up  good heaven  what was that which sent the blood tingling to his heart and deprived him of his voice and of power to move therethereat the windowclose before himso close that he could have almost touched him before he started back  with his eyes peering into the room and meeting his  there stood the jew  and beside him white with rage or fear or both were the scowling features of the man who had accosted him in the innyard  it was but an instant a glance a flash before his eyes and they were gone  but they had recognised him and he them and their look was as firmly impressed upon his memory as if it had been deeply carved in stone and set before him from his birth he stood transfixed for a moment then leaping from the window into the garden called loudly for help
