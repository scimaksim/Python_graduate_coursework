chapter xxvi  in which a mysterious character appears upon the scene and many things inseparable from this history are done and performed  the old man had gained the street corner before he began to recover the effect of toby crackits intelligence  he had relaxed nothing of his unusual speed but was still pressing onward in the same wild and disordered manner when the sudden dashing past of a carriage and a boisterous cry from the foot passengers who saw his danger  drove him back upon the pavement  avoiding as much as was possible all the main streets and skulking only through the byways and alleys he at length emerged on snow hill  here he walked even faster than before nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court when as if conscious that he was now in his proper element he fell into his usual shuffling pace and seemed to breathe more freely  near to the spot on which snow hill and holborn hill meet opens upon the right hand as you come out of the city a narrow and dismal alley leading to saffron hill  in its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of secondhand silk handkerchiefs of all sizes and patterns for here reside the traders who purchase them from pickpockets hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting from the doorposts and the shelves within are piled with them confined as the limits of field lane are it has its barber its coffeeshop its beershop and its friedfish warehouse it is a commercial colony of itself  the emporium of petty larceny visited at early morning and settingin of dusk by silent merchants who traffic in dark backparlours and who go as strangely as they come  here the clothesman the shoevamper and the ragmerchant display their goods as signboards to the petty thief here stores of old iron and bones and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollenstuff and linen rust and rot in the grimy cellars  it was into this place that the jew turned  he was well known to the sallow denizens of the lane for such of them as were on the lookout to buy or sell nodded familiarly as he passed along he replied to their salutations in the same way but bestowed no closer recognition until he reached the further end of the alley when he stopped to address a salesman of small stature who had squeezed as much of his person into a childs chair as the chair would hold and was smoking a pipe at his warehouse door  why the sight of you mr fagin would cure the hoptalmy said this respectable trader in acknowledgment of the jews inquiry after his health  the neighbourhood was a little too hot lively said fagin elevating his eyebrows and crossing his hands upon his shoulders  well ive heerd that complaint of it once or twice before replied the trader but it soon cools down again dont you find it so  fagin nodded in the affirmative  pointing in the direction of saffron hill he inquired whether any one was up yonder tonight  at the cripples inquired the man  the jew nodded  let me see pursued the merchant reflecting  yes theres some halfdozen of em gone in that i knows i dont think your friends there  sikes is not i suppose inquired the jew with a disappointed countenance  non istwentus as the lawyers say replied the little man shaking his head and looking amazingly sly  have you got anything in my line tonight  nothing tonight said the jew turning away  are you going up to the cripples fagin cried the little man calling after him  stop  i dont mind if i have a drop there with you  but as the jew looking back waved his hand to intimate that he preferred being alone and moreover as the little man could not very easily disengage himself from the chair the sign of the cripples was for a time bereft of the advantage of mr livelys presence  by the time he had got upon his legs the jew had disappeared so mr lively after ineffectually standing on tiptoe in the hope of catching sight of him again forced himself into the little chair and exchanging a shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop in which doubt and mistrust were plainly mingled resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour  the three cripples or rather the cripples which was the sign by which the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons  was the publichouse in which mr sikes and his dog have already figured merely making a sign to a man at the bar fagin walked straight upstairs and opening the door of a room and softly insinuating himself into the chamber looked anxiously about shading his eyes with his hand as if in search of some particular person  the room was illuminated by two gaslights the glare of which was prevented by the barred shutters and closelydrawn curtains of faded red from being visible outside  the ceiling was blackened to prevent its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps and the place was so full of dense tobacco smoke that at first it was scarcely possible to discern anything more  by degrees however as some of it cleared away through the open door an assemblage of heads as confused as the noises that greeted the ear might be made out and as the eye grew more accustomed to the scene the spectator gradually became aware of the presence of a numerous company male and female crowded round a long table at the upper end of which sat a chairman with a hammer of office in his hand while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache presided at a jingling piano in a remote corner  as fagin stepped softly in the professional gentleman running over the keys by way of prelude occasioned a general cry of order for a song which having subsided a young lady proceeded to entertain the company with a ballad in four verses between each of which the accompanyist played the melody all through as loud as he could  when this was over the chairman gave a sentiment after which the professional gentleman on the chairmans right and left volunteered a duet and sang it with great applause  it was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from among the group  there was the chairman himself the landlord of the house a coarse rough heavy built fellow who while the songs were proceeding rolled his eyes hither and thither and seeming to give himself up to joviality had an eye for everything that was done and an ear for everything that was saidand sharp ones too  near him were the singers receiving with professional indifference the compliments of the company and applying themselves in turn to a dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water tendered by their more boisterous admirers whose countenances expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade irresistibly attracted the attention by their very repulsiveness  cunning ferocity and drunkeness in all its stages were there in their strongest aspect and women some with the last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you looked  others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten out and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime some mere girls others but young women and none past the prime of life formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture  fagin troubled by no grave emotions looked eagerly from face to face while these proceedings were in progress but apparently without meeting that of which he was in search succeeding at length in catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair he beckoned to him slightly and left the room as quietly as he had entered it  what can i do for you mr fagin inquired the man as he followed him out to the landing  wont you join us  theyll be delighted every one of em  the jew shook his head impatiently and said in a whisper is he here  no replied the man  and no news of barney inquired fagin  none replied the landlord of the cripples for it was he he wont stir till its all safe  depend on it theyre on the scent down there and that if he moved hed blow upon the thing at once  hes all right enough barney is else i should have heard of him  ill pound it that barneys managing properly let him alone for that  will he be here tonight asked the jew laying the same emphasis on the pronoun as before  monks do you mean inquired the landlord hesitating  hush said the jew  yes  certain replied the man drawing a gold watch from his fob i expected him here before now  if youll wait ten minutes hell be  no no said the jew hastily as though however desirous he might be to see the person in question he was nevertheless relieved by his absence  tell him i came here to see him and that he must come to me tonight  no say tomorrow  as he is not here tomorrow will be time enough  good said the man  nothing more  not a word now said the jew descending the stairs  i say said the other looking over the rails and speaking in a hoarse whisper what a time this would be for a sell  ive got phil barker here so drunk that a boy might take him  ah  but its not phil barkers time said the jew looking up  phil has something more to do before we can afford to part with him so go back to the company my dear and tell them to lead merry liveswhile they last  ha ha ha  the landlord reciprocated the old mans laugh and returned to his guests  the jew was no sooner alone than his countenance resumed its former expression of anxiety and thought  after a brief reflection he called a hackcabriolet and bade the man drive towards bethnal green he dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of mr sikess residence and performed the short remainder of the distance on foot  now muttered the jew as he knocked at the door if there is any deep play here i shall have it out of you my girl cunning as you are  she was in her room the woman said  fagin crept softly upstairs and entered it without any previous ceremony  the girl was alone lying with her head upon the table and her hair straggling over it  she has been drinking thought the jew cooly or perhaps she is only miserable  the old man turned to close the door as he made this reflection the noise thus occasioned roused the girl  she eyed his crafty face narrowly as she inquired to his recital of toby crackits story  when it was concluded she sank into her former attitude but spoke not a word  she pushed the candle impatiently away and once or twice as she feverishly changed her position shuffled her feet upon the ground but this was all  during the silence the jew looked restlessly about the room as if to assure himself that there were no appearances of sikes having covertly returned  apparently satisfied with his inspection he coughed twice or thrice and made as many efforts to open a conversation but the girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone  at length he made another attempt and rubbing his hands together said in his most conciliatory tone  and where should you think bill was now my dear  the girl moaned out some half intelligible reply that she could not tell and seemed from the smothered noise that escaped her to be crying  and the boy too said the jew straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of her face  poor leetle child  left in a ditch nance only think  the child said the girl suddenly looking up is better where he is than among us and if no harm comes to bill from it i hope he lies dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there  what cried the jew in amazement  ay i do returned the girl meeting his gaze  i shall be glad to have him away from my eyes and to know that the worst is over  i cant bear to have him about me  the sight of him turns me against myself and all of you  pooh said the jew scornfully  youre drunk  am i cried the girl bitterly  its no fault of yours if i am not youd never have me anything else if you had your will except nowthe humour doesnt suit you doesnt it  no rejoined the jew furiously  it does not  change it then responded the girl with a laugh  change it exclaimed the jew exasperated beyond all bounds by his companions unexpected obstinacy and the vexation of the night i will change it  listen to me you drab  listen to me who with six words can strangle sikes as surely as if i had his bulls throat between my fingers now  if he comes back and leaves the boy behind him if he gets off free and dead or alive fails to restore him to me murder him yourself if you would have him escape jack ketch  and do it the moment he sets foot in this room or mind me it will be too late  what is all this cried the girl involuntarily  what is it pursued fagin mad with rage  when the boys worth hundreds of pounds to me am i to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting safely through the whims of a drunken gang that i could whistle away the lives of  and me bound too to a born devil that only wants the will and has the power to to  panting for breath the old man stammered for a word and in that instant checked the torrent of his wrath and changed his whole demeanour  a moment before his clenched hands had grasped the air his eyes had dilated and his face grown livid with passion but now he shrunk into a chair and cowering together trembled with the apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy  after a short silence he ventured to look round at his companion  he appeared somewhat reassured on beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused her  nancy dear croaked the jew in his usual voice  did you mind me dear  dont worry me now fagin replied the girl raising her head languidly  if bill has not done it this time he will another he has done many a good job for you and will do many more when he can and when he cant he wont so no more about that  regarding this boy my dear said the jew rubbing the palms of his hands nervously together  the boy must take his chance with the rest interrupted nancy hastily and i say again i hope he is dead and out of harms way and out of yoursthat is if bill comes to no harm  and if toby got clear off bills pretty sure to be safe for bills worth two of toby any time  and about what i was saying my dear observed the jew keeping his glistening eye steadily upon her  your must say it all over again if its anything you want me to do rejoined nancy and if it is you had better wait till tomorrow  you put me up for a minute but now im stupid again  fagin put several other questions all with the same drift of ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints but she answered them so readily and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor was confirmed  nancy indeed was not exempt from a failing which was very common among the jews female pupils and in which in their tenderer years they were rather encouraged than checked her disordered appearance and a wholesale perfume of geneva which pervaded the apartment afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the jews supposition and when after indulging in the temporary display of violence above described she subsided first into dullness and afterwards into a compound of feelings under the influence of which she shed tears one minute and in the next gave utterance to various exclamations of never say die and divers calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy mr fagin who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time saw with great satisfaction that she was very far gone indeed  having eased his mind by this discovery and having accomplished his twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had that night heard and of ascertaining with his own eyes that sikes had not returned mr fagin again turned his face homeward leaving his young friend asleep with her head upon the table  it was within an hour of midnight  the weather being dark and piercing cold he had no great temptation to loiter  the sharp wind that scoured the streets seemed to have cleared them of passengers as of dust and mud for few people were abroad and they were to all appearance hastening fast home it blew from the right quarter for the jew however and straight before it he went trembling and shivering as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way  he had reached the corner of his own street and was already fumbling in his pocket for the doorkey when a dark figure emerged from a projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow and crossing the road glided up to him unperceived  fagin whispered a voice close to his ear  ah said the jew turning quickly round is that  yes interrupted the stranger  i have been lingering here these two hours  where the devil have you been  on your business my dear replied the jew glancing uneasily at his companion and slackening his pace as he spoke  on your business all night  oh of course said the stranger with a sneer  well and whats come of it  nothing good said the jew  nothing bad i hope said the stranger stopping short and turning a startled look on his companion  the jew shook his head and was about to reply when the stranger interrupting him motioned to the house before which they had by this time arrived  remarking that he had better say what he had got to say under cover  for his blood was chilled with standing about so long and the wind blew through him  fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking home a visitor at that unseasonable hour and indeed muttered something about having no fire but his companion repeating his request in a peremptory manner he unlocked the door and requested him to close it softly while he got a light  its as dark as the grave said the man groping forward a few steps make haste  shut the door whispered fagin from the end of the passage as he spoke it closed with a loud noise  that wasnt my doing said the other man feeling his way the wind blew it to or it shut of its own accord one or the other look sharp with the light or i shall knock my brains out against something in this confounded hole  fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs  after a short absence he returned with a lighted candle and the intelligence that toby crackit was asleep in the back room below and that the boys were in the front one  beckoning the man to follow him he led the way upstairs  we can say the few words weve got to say in here my dear said the jew throwing open a door on the first floor and as there are holes in the shutters and we never show lights to our neighbours well set the candle on the stairs  there  with those words the jew stooping down placed the candle on an upper flight of stairs exactly opposite to the room door  this done he led the way into the apartment which was destitute of all movables save a broken armchair and an old couch or sofa without covering which stood behind the door  upon this piece of furniture the stranger sat himself with the air of a weary man and the jew drawing up the armchair opposite they sat face to face  it was not quite dark the door was partially open and the candle outside threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall  they conversed for some time in whispers  though nothing of the conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and there a listener might easily have perceived that fagin appeared to be defending himself against some remarks of the stranger and that the latter was in a state of considerable irritation  they might have been talking thus for a quarter of an hour or more when monksby which name the jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of their colloquysaid raising his voice a little  i tell you again it was badly planned  why not have kept him here among the rest and made a sneaking snivelling pickpocket of him at once  only hear him exclaimed the jew shrugging his shoulders  why do you mean to say you couldnt have done it if you had chosen demanded monks sternly  havent you done it with other boys scores of times  if you had had patience for a twelvemonth at most couldnt you have got him convicted and sent safely out of the kingdom perhaps for life  whose turn would that have served my dear inquired the jew humbly  mine replied monks  but not mine said the jew submissively  he might have become of use to me  when there are two parties to a bargain it is only reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted is it my good friend  what then demanded monks  i saw it was not easy to train him to the business replied the jew he was not like other boys in the same circumstances  curse him no muttered the man or he would have been a thief long ago  i had no hold upon him to make him worse pursued the jew anxiously watching the countenance of his companion  his hand was not in  i had nothing to frighten him with which we always must have in the beginning or we labour in vain  what could i do  send him out with the dodger and charley  we had enough of that at first my dear i trembled for us all  that was not my doing observed monks  no no my dear renewed the jew  and i dont quarrel with it now because if it had never happened you might never have clapped eyes on the boy to notice him and so led to the discovery that it was him you were looking for  well  i got him back for you by means of the girl and then she begins to favour him  throttle the girl said monks impatiently  why we cant afford to do that just now my dear replied the jew smiling and besides that sort of thing is not in our way or one of these days i might be glad to have it done  i know what these girls are monks well  as soon as the boy begins to harden shell care no more for him than for a block of wood  you want him made a thief  if he is alive i can make him one from this time and ifif said the jew drawing nearer to the otherits not likely mindbut if the worst comes to the worst and he is dead  its no fault of mine if he is interposed the other man with a look of terror and clasping the jews arm with trembling hands  mind that  fagin  i had no hand in it  anything but his death i told you from the first  i wont shed blood its always found out and haunts a man besides  if they shot him dead i was not the cause do you hear me  fire this infernal den  whats that  what cried the jew grasping the coward round the body with both arms as he sprung to his feet  where  yonder replied the man glaring at the opposite wall  the shadow i saw the shadow of a woman in a cloak and bonnet pass along the wainscot like a breath  the jew released his hold and they rushed tumultuously from the room the candle wasted by the draught was standing where it had been placed  it showed them only the empty staircase and their own white faces  they listened intently  a profound silence reigned throughout the house  its your fancy said the jew taking up the light and turning to his companion  ill swear i saw it replied monks trembling  it was bending forward when i saw it first and when i spoke it darted away  the jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate and telling him he could follow if he pleased ascended the stairs  they looked into all the rooms they were cold bare and empty  they descended into the passage and thence into the cellars below  the green damp hung upon the low walls the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the light of the candle but all was still as death  what do you think now said the jew when they had regained the passage  besides ourselves theres not a creature in the house except toby and the boys and theyre safe enough see here  as a proof of the fact the jew drew forth two keys from his pocket and explained that when he first went downstairs he had locked them in to prevent any intrusion on the conference  this accumulated testimony effectually staggered mr monks his protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they proceeded in their search without making any discovery and now he gave vent to several very grim laughs and confessed it could only have been his excited imagination  he declined any renewal of the conversation however for that night  suddenly remembering that it was past one oclock  and so the amiable couple parted
