chapter xxv  wherein this history reverts to mr fagin and company  while these things were passing in the country workhouse mr fagin sat in the old denthe same from which oliver had been removed by the girlbrooding over a dull smoky fire  he held a pair of bellows upon his knee with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful action but he had fallen into deep thought and with his arms folded on them and his chin resting on his thumbs fixed his eyes abstractedly on the rusty bars  at a table behind him sat the artful dodger master charles bates and mr chitling all intent upon a game of whist the artful taking dummy against master bates and mr chitling  the countenance of the firstnamed gentleman peculiarly intelligent at all times acquired great additional interest from his close observance of the game and his attentive perusal of mr chitlings hand upon which from time to time as occasion served he bestowed a variety of earnest glances wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon his neighbours cards  it being a cold night the dodger wore his hat as indeed was often his custom within doors  he also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth which he only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot upon the table which stood ready filled with ginandwater for the accommodation of the company  master bates was also attentive to the play but being of a more excitable nature than his accomplished friend it was observable that he more frequently applied himself to the ginandwater and moreover indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks all highly unbecoming a scientific rubber  indeed the artful presuming upon their close attachment more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these improprieties all of which remonstrances master bates received in extremely good part merely requesting his friend to be blowed or to insert his head in a sack or replying with some other neatlyturned witticism of a similar kind the happy application of which excited considerable admiration in the mind of mr chitling it was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost and that the circumstance so far from angering master bates appeared to afford him the highest amusement inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end of every deal and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in all his born days  thats two doubles and the rub said mr chitling with a very long face as he drew halfacrown from his waistcoatpocket  i never see such a feller as you jack you win everything  even when weve good cards charley and i cant make nothing of em  either the master or the manner of this remark which was made very ruefully delighted charley bates so much that his consequent shout of laughter roused the jew from his reverie and induced him to inquire what was the matter  matter fagin cried charley  i wish you had watched the play tommy chitling hasnt won a point and i went partners with him against the artfull and dumb  ay ay said the jew with a grin which sufficiently demonstrated that he was at no loss to understand the reason try em again tom try em again  no more of it for me thank ee fagin replied mr chitling ive had enough  that ere dodger has such a run of luck that theres no standing again him  ha ha my dear replied the jew you must get up very early in the morning to win against the dodger  morning said charley bates you must put your boots on overnight and have a telescope at each eye and a operaglass between your shoulders if you want to come over him  mr dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy and offered to cut any gentleman in company for the first picturecard at a shilling at a time  nobody accepting the challenge and his pipe being by this time smoked out he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a groundplan of newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters whistling meantime with peculiar shrillness  how precious dull you are tommy said the dodger stopping short when there had been a long silence and addressing mr chitling  what do you think hes thinking of fagin  how should i know my dear replied the jew looking round as he plied the bellows  about his losses maybe or the little retirement in the country that hes just left eh  ha ha  is that it my dear  not a bit of it replied the dodger stopping the subject of discourse as mr chitling was about to reply  what do you say charley  i should say replied master bates with a grin that he was uncommon sweet upon betsy  see how hes ablushing  oh my eye heres a merrygorounder  tommy chitlings in love  oh fagin fagin what a spree  thoroughly overpowered with the notion of mr chitling being the victim of the tender passion master bates threw himself back in his chair with such violence that he lost his balance and pitched over upon the floor where the accident abating nothing of his merriment he lay at full length until his laugh was over when he resumed his former position and began another laugh  never mind him my dear said the jew winking at mr dawkins and giving master bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows betsys a fine girl  stick up to her tom  stick up to her  what i mean to say fagin replied mr chitling very red in the face is that that isnt anything to anybody here  no more it is replied the jew charley will talk  dont mind him my dear dont mind him  betsys a fine girl  do as she bids you tom and you will make your fortune  so i do do as she bids me replied mr chitling i shouldnt have been milled if it hadnt been for her advice  but it turned out a good job for you didnt it fagin  and whats six weeks of it  it must come some time or another and why not in the winter time when you dont want to go out awalking so much eh fagin  ah to be sure my dear replied the jew  you wouldnt mind it again tom would you asked the dodger winking upon charley and the jew if bet was all right  i mean to say that i shouldnt replied tom angrily there now ah  wholl say as much as that i should like to know eh fagin  nobody my dear replied the jew not a soul tom  i dont know one of em that would do it besides you not one of em my dear  i might have got clear off if id split upon her mightnt i fagin angrily pursued the poor halfwitted dupe  a word from me would have done it wouldnt it fagin  to be sure it would my dear replied the jew  but i didnt blab it did i fagin demanded tom pouring question upon question with great volubility  no no to be sure replied the jew you were too stouthearted for that  a deal too stout my dear  perhaps i was rejoined tom looking round and if i was whats to laugh at in that eh fagin  the jew perceiving that mr chitling was considerably roused hastened to assure him that nobody was laughing and to prove the gravity of the company appealed to master bates the principal offender  but unfortunately charley in opening his mouth to reply that he was never more serious in his life was unable to prevent the escape of such a violent roar that the abused mr chitling without any preliminary ceremonies rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender who being skilful in evading pursuit ducked to avoid it and chose his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman and caused him to stagger to the wall where he stood panting for breath while mr chitling looked on in intense dismay  hark cried the dodger at this moment i heard the tinkler catching up the light he crept softly upstairs  the bell was rung again with some impatience while the party were in darkness  after a short pause the dodger reappeared and whispered fagin mysteriously  what cried the jew alone  the dodger nodded in the affirmative and shading the flame of the candle with his hand gave charley bates a private intimation in dumb show that he had better not be funny just then  having performed this friendly office he fixed his eyes on the jews face and awaited his directions  the old man bit his yellow fingers and meditated for some seconds his face working with agitation the while as if he dreaded something and feared to know the worst  at length he raised his head  where is he he asked  the dodger pointed to the floor above and made a gesture as if to leave the room  yes said the jew answering the mute inquiry bring him down hush quiet charley  gently tom  scarce scarce  this brief direction to charley bates and his recent antagonist was softly and immediately obeyed  there was no sound of their whereabout when the dodger descended the stairs bearing the light in his hand and followed by a man in a coarse smockfrock who after casting a hurried glance round the room pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the lower portion of his face and disclosed all haggard unwashed and unshorn the features of flash toby crackit  how are you faguey said this worthy nodding to the jew pop that shawl away in my castor dodger so that i may know where to find it when i cut thats the time of day  youll be a fine young cracksman afore the old file now  with these words he pulled up the smockfrock and winding it round his middle drew a chair to the fire and placed his feet upon the hob  see there faguey he said pointing disconsolately to his top boots not a drop of day and martin since you know when not a bubble of blacking by jove   but dont look at me in that way man  all in good time  i cant talk about business till ive eat and drank so produce the sustainance and lets have a quiet fillout for the first time these three days  the jew motioned to the dodger to place what eatables there were upon the table and seating himself opposite the housebreaker waited his leisure  to judge from appearances toby was by no means in a hurry to open the conversation  at first the jew contented himself with patiently watching his countenance as if to gain from its expression some clue to the intelligence he brought but in vain  he looked tired and worn but there was the same complacent repose upon his features that they always wore  and through dirt and beard and whisker there still shone unimpaired the selfsatisfied smirk of flash toby crackit then the jew in an agony of impatience watched every morsel he put into his mouth pacing up and down the room meanwhile in irrepressible excitement  it was all of no use  toby continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference until he could eat no more then ordering the dodger out he closed the door mixed a glass of spirits and water and composed himself for talking  first and foremost faguey said toby  yes yes interposed the jew drawing up his chair  mr crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water and to declare that the gin was excellent then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye he quietly resumed  first and foremost faguey said the housebreaker hows bill  what screamed the jew starting from his seat  why you dont mean to say began toby turning pale  mean cried the jew stamping furiously on the ground where are they  sikes and the boy  where are they  where have they been where are they hiding  why have they not been here  the crack failed said toby faintly  i know it replied the jew tearing a newspaper from his pocket and pointing to it  what more  they fired and hit the boy  we cut over the fields at the back with him between usstraight as the crow fliesthrough hedge and ditch they gave chase  damme the whole country was awake and the dogs upon us  the boy  bill had him on his back and scudded like the wind  we stopped to take him between us his head hung down and he was cold they were close upon our heels every man for himself and each from the gallows we parted company and left the youngster lying in a ditch  alive or dead thats all i know about him  the jew stopped to hear no more but uttering a loud yell and twining his hands in his hair rushed from the room and from the house
