chapter xlv  noah claypole is employed by fagin on a secret mission  the old man was up betimes next morning and waited impatiently for the appearance of his new associate who after a delay that seemed interminable at length presented himself and commenced a voracious assault on the breakfast  bolter said fagin drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite morris bolter  well here i am returned noah  whats the matter  dont yer ask me to do anything till i have done eating thats a great fault in this place  yer never get time enough over yer meals  you can talk as you eat cant you said fagin cursing his dear young friends greediness from the very bottom of his heart  oh yes i can talk  i get on better when i talk said noah cutting a monstrous slice of bread  wheres charlotte  out said fagin  i sent her out this morning with the other young woman because i wanted us to be alone  oh said noah  i wish yerd ordered her to make some buttered toast first  well  talk away  yer wont interrupt me  there seemed indeed no great fear of anything interrupting him as he had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of business  you did well yesterday my dear said fagin  beautiful  six shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day  the kinchin lay will be a fortune to you  dont you forget to add three pintpots and a milkcan said mr bolter  no no my dear  the pintpots were great strokes of genius but the milkcan was a perfect masterpiece  pretty well i think for a beginner remarked mr bolter complacently  the pots i took off airy railings and the milkcan was standing by itself outside a publichouse  i thought it might get rusty with the rain or catch cold yer know  eh  ha ha ha  fagin affected to laugh very heartily and mr bolter having had his laugh out took a series of large bites which finished his first hunk of bread and butter and assisted himself to a second  i want you bolter said fagin leaning over the table to do a piece of work for me my dear that needs great care and caution  i say rejoined bolter dont yer go shoving me into danger or sending me any more o yer policeoffices that dont suit me that dont and so i tell yer  thats not the smallest danger in itnot the very smallest said the jew its only to dodge a woman  an old woman demanded mr bolter  a young one replied fagin  i can do that pretty well i know said bolter  i was a regular cunning sneak when i was at school  what am i to dodge her for  not to  not to do anything but to tell me where she goes who she sees and if possible what she says to remember the street if it is a street or the house if it is a house and to bring me back all the information you can  whatll yer give me asked noah setting down his cup and looking his employer eagerly in the face  if you do it well a pound my dear  one pound said fagin wishing to interest him in the scent as much as possible  and thats what i never gave yet for any job of work where there wasnt valuable consideration to be gained  who is she inquired noah  one of us  oh lor cried noah curling up his nose  yer doubtful of her are yer  she has found out some new friends my dear and i must know who they are replied fagin  i see said noah  just to have the pleasure of knowing them if theyre respectable people eh  ha ha ha im your man  i knew you would be cried fagin elated by the success of his proposal  of course of course replied noah  where is she where am i to wait for her  where am i to go  all that my dear you shall hear from me  ill point her out at the proper time said fagin  you keep ready and leave the rest to me  that night and the next and the next again the spy sat booted and equipped in his carters dress  ready to turn out at a word from fagin  six nights passedsix long weary nightsand on each fagin came home with a disappointed face and briefly intimated that it was not yet time  on the seventh he returned earlier and with an exultation he could not conceal  it was sunday  she goes abroad tonight said fagin and on the right errand im sure for she has been alone all day and the man she is afraid of will not be back much before daybreak  come with me quick  noah started up without saying a word for the jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him  they left the house stealthily and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets arrived at length before a publichouse which noah recognised as the same in which he had slept on the night of his arrival in london  it was past eleven oclock and the door was closed  it opened softly on its hinges as fagin gave a low whistle they entered without noise and the door was closed behind them  scarcely venturing to whisper but substituting dumb show for words fagin and the young jew who had admitted them pointed out the pane of glass to noah and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room  is that the woman he asked scarcely above his breath  fagin nodded yes  i cant see her face well whispered noah  she is looking down and the candle is behind her  stay there whispered fagin  he signed to barney who withdrew  in an instant the lad entered the room adjoining and under pretence of snuffing the candle moved it in the required position and speaking to the girl caused her to raise her face  i see her now cried the spy  plainly  i should know her among a thousand  he hastily descended as the roomdoor opened and the girl came out fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment and emerged by the door at which they had entered  hist cried the lad who held the door  dow  noah exchanged a look with fagin and darted out  to the left whispered the lad take the left had and keep od the other side  he did so and by the light of the lamps saw the girls retreating figure already at some distance before him  he advanced as near as he considered prudent and kept on the opposite side of the street the better to observe her motions she looked nervously round twice or thrice and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her pass on  she seemed to gather courage as she advanced and to walk with a steadier and firmer step  the spy preserved the same relative distance between them and followed  with his eye upon her
