chapter xx  wherein oliver is delivered over to mr william sikes  when oliver awoke in the morning he was a good deal surprised to find that a new pair of shoes with strong thick soles had been placed at his bedside and that his old shoes had been removed at first he was pleased with the discovery hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release but such thoughts were quickly dispelled on his sitting down to breakfast along with the jew who told him in a tone and manner which increased his alarm that he was to be taken to the residence of bill sikes that night  totostop there sir asked oliver anxiously  no no my dear  not to stop there replied the jew  we shouldnt like to lose you  dont be afraid oliver you shall come back to us again  ha ha ha  we wont be so cruel as to send you away my dear oh no no  the old man who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread looked round as he bantered oliver thus and chuckled as if to show that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could  i suppose said the jew fixing his eyes on oliver you want to know what youre going to bills foreh my dear  oliver coloured involuntarily to find that the old thief had been reading his thoughts but boldly said yes he did want to know  why do you think inquired fagin parrying the question  indeed i dont know sir replied oliver  bah said the jew turning away with a disappointed countenance from a close perusal of the boys face  wait till bill tells you then  the jew seemed much vexed by olivers not expressing any greater curiosity on the subject but the truth is that although oliver felt very anxious he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of fagins looks and his own speculations to make any further inquiries just then  he had no other opportunity  for the jew remained very surly and silent till night  when he prepared to go abroad  you may burn a candle said the jew putting one upon the table and heres a book for you to read till they come to fetch you goodnight  goodnight replied oliver softly  the jew walked to the door looking over his shoulder at the boy as he went  suddenly stopping he called him by his name  oliver looked up the jew pointing to the candle motioned him to light it  he did so and as he placed the candlestick upon the table saw that the jew was gazing fixedly at him with lowering and contracted brows from the dark end of the room  take heed oliver take heed said the old man shaking his right hand before him in a warning manner  hes a rough man and thinks nothing of blood when his own is up whatever falls out say nothing and do what he bids you  mind  placing a strong emphasis on the last word he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin and nodding his head left the room  oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared and pondered with a trembling heart on the words he had just heard  the more he thought of the jews admonition the more he was at a loss to divine its real purpose and meaning  he could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to sikes which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with fagin and after meditating for a long time concluded that he had been selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker until another boy better suited for his purpose could be engaged  he was too well accustomed to suffering and had suffered too much where he was to bewail the prospect of change very severely  he remained lost in thought for some minutes and then with a heavy sigh snuffed the candle and taking up the book which the jew had left with him began to read  he turned over the leaves  carelessly at first but lighting on a passage which attracted his attention he soon became intent upon the volume  it was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use here he read of dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold of secret murders that had been committed by the lonely wayside of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and wells which would not keep them down deep as they were but had yielded them up at last after many years and so maddened the murderers with the sight that in their horror they had confessed their guilt and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony here too he read of men who lying in their beds at dead of night had been tempted so they said and led on by their own bad thoughts to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep and the limbs quail to think of  the terrible descriptions were so real and vivid that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore and the words upon them to be sounded in his ears as if they were whispered in hollow murmurs by the spirits of the dead  in a paroxysm of fear the boy closed the book and thrust it from him then falling upon his knees he prayed heaven to spare him from such deeds and rather to will that he should die at once than be reserved for crimes so fearful and appalling by degrees he grew more calm and besought in a low and broken voice that he might be rescued from his present dangers and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred it might come to him now when desolate and deserted he stood alone in the midst of wickedness and guilt  he had concluded his prayer but still remained with his head buried in his hands when a rustling noise aroused him  whats that he cried starting up and catching sight of a figure standing by the door  whos there  me  only me replied a tremulous voice  oliver raised the candle above his head and looked towards the door it was nancy  put down the light said the girl turning away her head it hurts my eyes  oliver saw that she was very pale and gently inquired if she were ill the girl threw herself into a chair with her back towards him  and wrung her hands but made no reply  god forgive me she cried after a while i never thought of this  has anything happened asked oliver  can i help you  i will if i can  i will indeed  she rocked herself to and fro caught her throat and uttering a gurgling sound gasped for breath  nancy cried oliver what is it  the girl beat her hands upon her knees and her feet upon the ground and suddenly stopping drew her shawl close round her and shivered with cold  oliver stirred the fire  drawing her chair close to it she sat there for a little time without speaking but at length she raised her head and looked round  i dont know what comes over me sometimes said she affecting to busy herself in arranging her dress its this damp dirty room i think  now nolly dear are you ready  am i to go with you asked oliver  yes  i have come from bill replied the girl  you are to go with me  what for asked oliver recoiling  what for echoed the girl raising her eyes and averting them again the moment they encountered the boys face  oh  for no harm  i dont believe it said oliver  who had watched her closely  have it your own way rejoined the girl affecting to laugh for no good then  oliver could see that he had some power over the girls better feelings and for an instant thought of appealing to her compassion for his helpless state  but then the thought darted across his mind that it was barely eleven oclock and that many people were still in the streets  of whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale  as the reflection occured to him he stepped forward  and said somewhat hastily that he was ready  neither his brief consideration nor its purport was lost on his companion  she eyed him narrowly while he spoke and cast upon him a look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been passing in his thoughts  hush said the girl stooping over him and pointing to the door as she looked cautiously round  you cant help yourself i have tried hard for you but all to no purpose  you are hedged round and round if ever you are to get loose from here this is not the time  struck by the energy of her manner oliver looked up in her face with great surprise  she seemed to speak the truth her countenance was white and agitated and she trembled with very earnestness  i have saved you from being illused once and i will again and i do now continued the girl aloud for those who would have fetched you if i had not would have been far more rough than me  i have promised for your being quiet and silent if you are not you will only do harm to yourself and me too and perhaps be my death  see here  i have borne all this for you already as true as god sees me show it  she pointed hastily to some livid bruises on her neck and arms and continued with great rapidity  remember this  and dont let me suffer more for you just now if i could help you i would but i have not the power  they dont mean to harm you whatever they make you do is no fault of yours  hush every word from you is a blow for me  give me your hand  make haste your hand  she caught the hand which oliver instinctively placed in hers and blowing out the light drew him after her up the stairs the door was opened quickly by some one shrouded in the darkness and was as quickly closed when they had passed out  a hackneycabriolet was in waiting with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing oliver the girl pulled him in with her and drew the curtains close the driver wanted no directions but lashed his horse into full speed without the delay of an instant  the girl still held oliver fast by the hand and continued to pour into his ear the warnings and assurances she had already imparted  all was so quick and hurried that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was or how he came there when the carriage stopped at the house to which the jews steps had been directed on the previous evening  for one brief moment oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street and a cry for help hung upon his lips  but the girls voice was in his ear beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her that he had not the heart to utter it while he hesitated the opportunity was gone he was already in the house and the door was shut  this way said the girl releasing her hold for the first time bill  hallo replied sikes appearing at the head of the stairs with a candle  oh  thats the time of day  come on  this was a very strong expression of approbation an uncommonly hearty welcome from a person of mr sikes temperament  nancy appearing much gratified thereby saluted him cordially  bullseyes gone home with tom observed sikes as he lighted them up  hed have been in the way  thats right rejoined nancy  so youve got the kid said sikes when they had all reached the room closing the door as he spoke  yes here he is replied nancy  did he come quiet inquired sikes  like a lamb rejoined nancy  im glad to hear it said sikes looking grimly at oliver for the sake of his young carcase  as would otherways have suffered for it come here young un and let me read you a lectur which is as well got over at once  thus addressing his new pupil mr sikes pulled off olivers cap and threw it into a corner and then taking him by the shoulder sat himself down by the table and stood the boy in front of him  now first  do you know wot this is inquired sikes taking up a pocketpistol which lay on the table  oliver replied in the affirmative  well then look here continued sikes  this is powder that eres a bullet and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin  oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to and mr sikes proceeded to load the pistol with great nicety and deliberation  now its loaded said mr sikes when he had finished  yes i see it is sir replied oliver  well said the robber grasping olivers wrist and putting the barrel so close to his temple that they touched at which moment the boy could not repress a start if you speak a word when youre out odoors with me except when i speak to you that loading will be in your head without notice  so if you do make up your mind to speak without leave say your prayers first  having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning to increase its effect mr sikes continued  as near as i know there isnt anybody as would be asking very partickler arter you if you was disposed of so i neednt take this devilandall of trouble to explain matters to you if it warnt for your own good  dye hear me  the short and the long of what you mean said nancy  speaking very emphatically and slightly frowning at oliver as if to bespeak his serious attention to her words  is that if youre crossed by him in this job you have on hand youll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards by shooting him through the head and will take your chance of swinging for it as you do for a great many other things in the way of business every month of your life  thats it observed mr sikes approvingly women can always put things in fewest wordsexcept when its blowing up and then they lengthens it out  and now that hes thoroughly up to it lets have some supper and get a snooze before starting  in pursuance of this request nancy quickly laid the cloth disappearing for a few minutes she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish of sheeps heads which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on the part of mr sikes founded upon the singular coincidence of jemmies being a can name common to them and also to an ingenious implement much used in his profession  indeed the worthy gentleman stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on active service was in great spirits and good humour in proof whereof it may be here remarked that he humourously drank all the beer at a draught and did not utter on a rough calculation more than fourscore oaths during the whole progress of the meal  supper being endedit may be easily conceived that oliver had no great appetite for itmr sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits and water and threw himself on the bed ordering nancy with many imprecations in case of failure to call him at five precisely  oliver stretched himself in his clothes by command of the same authority on a mattress upon the floor and the girl mending the fire sat before it in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time  for a long time oliver lay awake thinking it not impossible that nancy might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice but the girl sat brooding over the fire without moving save now and then to trim the light  weary with watching and anxiety he at length fell asleep  when he awoke the table was covered with teathings and sikes was thrusting various articles into the pockets of his greatcoat which hung over the back of a chair  nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast  it was not yet daylight for the candle was still burning and it was quite dark outside a sharp rain too was beating against the windowpanes and the sky looked black and cloudy  now then growled sikes as oliver started up halfpast five look sharp or youll get no breakfast for its late as it is  oliver was not long in making his toilet having taken some breakfast he replied to a surly inquiry from sikes by saying that he was quite ready  nancy scarcely looking at the boy threw him a handkerchief to tie round his throat sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his shoulders  thus attired he gave his hand to the robber who merely pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol in a sidepocket of his greatcoat clasped it firmly in his and exchanging a farewell with nancy led him away  oliver turned for an instant when they reached the door in the hope of meeting a look from the girl  but she had resumed her old seat in front of the fire and sat perfectly motionless before it
