chapter xiii  some new acquaintances are introduced to the intelligent reader connected with whom various pleasant matters are related appertaining to this history  wheres oliver said the jew rising with a menacing look wheres the boy  the young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his violence and looked uneasily at each other  but they made no reply  whats become of the boy said the jew seizing the dodger tightly by the collar and threatening him with horrid imprecations  speak out or ill throttle you  mr fagin looked so very much in earnest that charley bates who deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side and who conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second dropped upon his knees and raised a loud wellsustained and continuous roarsomething between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet  will you speak thundered the jew  shaking the dodger so much that his keeping in the big coat at all seemed perfectly miraculous  why the traps have got him and thats all about it said the dodger sullenly  come let go o me will you  and swinging himself at one jerk clean out of the big coat which he left in the jews hands the dodger snatched up the toasting fork and made a pass at the merry old gentlemans waistcoat which if it had taken effect would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily replaced  the jew stepped back in this emergency with more agility than could have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude and seizing up the pot prepared to hurl it at his assailants head  but charley bates at this moment calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl he suddenly altered its destination and flung it full at that young gentleman  why what the blazes is in the wind now growled a deep voice who pitched that ere at me  its well its the beer and not the pot as hit me or id have settled somebody  i might have knowd as nobody but an infernal rich plundering thundering old jew could afford to throw away any drink but waterand not that unless he done the river company every quarter  wots it all about fagin  dme if my neckhandkercher ant lined with beer  come in you sneaking warmint wot are you stopping outside for as if you was ashamed of your master come in  the man who growled out these words was a stoutlybuilt fellow of about fiveandthirty in a black velveteen coat very soiled drab breeches laceup half boots and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair of legs with large swelling calvesthe kind of legs which in such costume always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set of fetters to garnish them  he had a brown hat on his head and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck  with the long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he spoke  he disclosed when he had done so a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days growth and two scowling eyes one of which displayed various particoloured symptoms of having been recently damaged by a blow  come in dye hear growled this engaging ruffian  a white shaggy dog with his face scratched and torn in twenty different places skulked into the room  why didnt you come in afore said the man  youre getting too proud to own me afore company are you  lie down  this command was accompanied with a kick which sent the animal to the other end of the room  he appeared well used to it however for he coiled himself up in a corner very quietly without uttering a sound and winking his very illlooking eyes twenty times in a minute appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment  what are you up to  illtreating the boys you covetous avaricious insatiable old fence said the man seating himself deliberately i wonder they dont murder you  i would if i was them  if id been your prentice id have done it long ago andno i couldnt have sold you afterwards for youre fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle and i suppose they dont blow glass bottles large enough  hush hush mr sikes said the jew trembling dont speak so loud  none of your mistering replied the ruffian you always mean mischief when you come that  you know my name  out with it  i shant disgrace it when the time comes  well well thenbill sikes said the jew with abject humility you seem out of humour bill  perhaps i am replied sikes i should think you was rather out of sorts too unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about as you do when you blab and  are you mad said the jew catching the man by the sleeve and pointing towards the boys  mr sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left ear and jerking his head over on the right shoulder a piece of dumb show which the jew appeared to understand perfectly  he then in cant terms with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here demanded a glass of liquor  and mind you dont poison it said mr sikes laying his hat upon the table  this was said in jest but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer with which the jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary or the wish at all events to improve upon the distillers ingenuity not very far from the old gentlemans merry heart  after swallowing two of three glasses of spirits mr sikes condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen which gracious act led to a conversation in which the cause and manner of olivers capture were circumstantially detailed with such alterations and improvements on the truth as to the dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances  im afraid said the jew that he may say something which will get us into trouble  thats very likely returned sikes with a malicious grin youre blowed upon fagin  and im afraid you see added the jew speaking as if he had not noticed the interruption and regarding the other closely as he did soim afraid that if the game was up with us it might be up with a good many more and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for me my dear  the man started and turned round upon the jew  but the old gentlemans shoulders were shrugged up to his ears and his eyes were vacantly staring on the opposite wall  there was a long pause every member of the respectable coterie appeared plunged in his own reflections not excepting the dog who by a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when he went out  somebody must find out wots been done at the office said mr sikes in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in  the jew nodded assent  if he hasnt peached and is committed theres no fear till he comes out again said mr sikes and then he must be taken care on  you must get hold of him somehow  again the jew nodded  the prudence of this line of action indeed was obvious but unfortunately there was one very strong objection to its being adopted  this was that the dodger and charley bates and fagin and mr william sikes happened one and all to entertain a violent and deeplyrooted antipathy to going near a policeoffice on any ground or pretext whatever  how long they might have sat and looked at each other in a state of uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind it is difficult to guess  it is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject however for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom oliver had seen on a former occasion caused the conversation to flow afresh  the very thing said the jew  bet will go wont you my dear  wheres inquired the young lady  only just up to the office my dear said the jew coaxingly  it is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that she would not but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest desire to be blessed if she would a polite and delicate evasion of the request which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellowcreature the pain of a direct and pointed refusal  the jews countenance fell  he turned from this young lady who was gaily not to say gorgeously attired in a red gown green boots and yellow curlpapers to the other female  nancy my dear said the jew in a soothing manner what do you say  that it wont do so its no use atrying it on fagin replied nancy  what do you mean by that said mr sikes looking up in a surly manner  what i say bill replied the lady collectedly  why youre just the very person for it reasoned mr sikes nobody about here knows anything of you  and as i dont want em to neither replied nancy in the same composed manner its rather more no than yes with me bill  shell go fagin said sikes  no she wont fagin said nancy  yes she will fagin said sikes  and mr sikes was right  by dint of alternate threats promises and bribes the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake the commission  she was not indeed withheld by the same considerations as her agreeable friend for having recently removed into the neighborhood of field lane from the remote but genteel suburb of ratcliffe she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances  accordingly with a clean white apron tied over her gown and her curlpapers tucked up under a straw bonnetboth articles of dress being provided from the jews inexhaustible stockmiss nancy prepared to issue forth on her errand  stop a minute my dear said the jew producing a little covered basket  carry that in one hand  it looks more respectable my dear  give her a doorkey to carry in her tother one fagin said sikes it looks real and genivine like  yes yes my dear so it does said the jew hanging a large streetdoor key on the forefinger of the young ladys right hand  there very good  very good indeed my dear said the jew rubbing his hands  oh my brother  my poor dear sweet innocent little brother exclaimed nancy bursting into tears and wringing the little basket and the streetdoor key in an agony of distress  what has become of him  where have they taken him to  oh do have pity and tell me whats been done with the dear boy gentlemen do gentlemen if you please gentlemen  having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heartbroken tone to the immeasurable delight of her hearers  miss nancy paused winked to the company nodded smilingly round and disappeared  ah shes a clever girl my dears said the jew turning round to his young friends and shaking his head gravely as if in mute admonition to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld  shes a honour to her sex said mr sikes filling his glass and smiting the table with his enormous fist  heres her health and wishing they was all like her  while these and many other encomiums were being passed on the accomplished nancy that young lady made the best of her way to the policeoffice whither notwithstanding a little natural timidity consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected she arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards  entering by the back way she tapped softly with the key at one of the celldoors and listened  there was no sound within  so she coughed and listened again  still there was no reply  so she spoke  nolly dear murmured nancy in a gentle voice nolly  there was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal who had been taken up for playing the flute and who the offence against society having been clearly proved had been very properly committed by mr fang to the house of correction for one month with the appropriate and amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare it would be more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument  he made no answer being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute which had been confiscated for the use of the county  so nancy passed on to the next cell and knocked there  well cried a faint and feeble voice  is there a little boy here inquired nancy with a preliminary sob  no replied the voice god forbid  this was a vagrant of sixtyfive who was going to prison for not playing the flute or in other words for begging in the streets and doing nothing for his livelihood  in the next cell was another man who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license thereby doing something for his living in defiance of the stampoffice  but as neither of these criminals answered to the name of oliver or knew anything about him nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the striped waistcoat and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the streetdoor key and the little basket demanded her own dear brother  i havent got him my dear said the old man  where is he screamed nancy in a distracted manner  why the gentlemans got him replied the officer  what gentleman  oh gracious heavens  what gentleman exclaimed nancy  in reply to this incoherent questioning the old man informed the deeply affected sister that oliver had been taken ill in the office and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have been committed by another boy not in custody and that the prosecutor had carried him away in an insensible condition to his own residence  of and concerning which all the informant knew was that it was somewhere in pentonville he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the coachman  in a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty the agonised young woman staggered to the gate and then exchanging her faltering walk for a swift run returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think of to the domicile of the jew  mr bill sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered than he very hastily called up the white dog and putting on his hat expeditiously departed  without devoting any time to the formality of wishing the company goodmorning  we must know where he is my dears he must be found said the jew greatly excited  charley do nothing but skulk about till you bring home some news of him  nancy my dear i must have him found  i trust to you my dearto you and the artful for everything  stay stay added the jew unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand theres money my dears  i shall shut up this shop tonight  youll know where to find me  dont stop here a minute  not an instant my dears  with these words he pushed them from the room  and carefully doublelocking and barring the door behind them drew from its place of concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to oliver then he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath his clothing  a rap at the door startled him in this occupation  whos there he cried in a shrill tone  me replied the voice of the dodger through the keyhole  what now cried the jew impatiently  is he to be kidnapped to the other ken nancy says inquired the dodger  yes replied the jew wherever she lays hands on him  find him find him out thats all  i shall know what to do next never fear  the boy murmured a reply of intelligence  and hurried downstairs after his companions  he has not peached so far said the jew as he pursued his occupation if he means to blab us among his new friends we may stop his mouth yet
