chapter iii  relates how oliver twist was very near getting a place which would not have been a sinecure  for a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of asking for more oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board  it appears at first sight not unreasonable to suppose that if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat he would have established that sage individuals prophetic character once and for ever by tying one end of his pockethandkerchief to a hook in the wall and attaching himself to the other  to the performance of this feat however there was one obstacle namely that pockethandkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury had been for all future times and ages removed from the noses of paupers by the express order of the board in council assembled solemnly given and pronounced under their hands and seals  there was a still greater obstacle in olivers youth and childishness  he only cried bitterly all day and when the long dismal night came on spread his little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness and crouching in the corner tried to sleep ever and anon waking with a start and tremble and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall as if to feel even its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which surrounded him  let it not be supposed by the enemies of the system that during the period of his solitary incarceration oliver was denied the benefit of exercise the pleasure of society or the advantages of religious consolation  as for exercise it was nice cold weather and he was allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump in a stone yard in the presence of mr bumble who prevented his catching cold and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame by repeated applications of the cane  as for society he was carried every other day into the hall where the boys dined and there sociably flogged as a public warning and example  and so far from being denied the advantages of religious consolation he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at prayertime and there permitted to listen to and console his mind with a general supplication of the boys containing a special clause therein inserted by authority of the board in which they entreated to be made good virtuous contented and obedient and to be guarded from the sins and vices of oliver twist whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness and an article direct from the manufactory of the very devil himself  it chanced one morning while olivers affairs were in this auspicious and comfortable state that mr gamfield chimneysweep went his way down the high street deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying certain arrears of rent for which his landlord had become rather pressing  mr gamfields most sanguine estimate of his finances could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount and in a species of arithmetical desperation he was alternately cudgelling his brains and his donkey when passing the workhouse his eyes encountered the bill on the gate  woo said mr gamfield to the donkey  the donkey was in a state of profound abstraction wondering probably whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbagestalk or two when he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was laden so without noticing the word of command he jogged onward  mr gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally but more particularly on his eyes and running after him bestowed a blow on his head which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkeys  then catching hold of the bridle he gave his jaw a sharp wrench by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master and by these means turned him round  he then gave him another blow on the head just to stun him till he came back again  having completed these arrangements he walked up to the gate to read the bill  the gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his hands behind him after having delivered himself of some profound sentiments in the boardroom  having witnessed the little dispute between mr gamfield and the donkey he smiled joyously when that person came up to read the bill for he saw at once that mr gamfield was exactly the sort of master oliver twist wanted  mr gamfield smiled too as he perused the document for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing for and as to the boy with which it was encumbered mr gamfield knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was well knew he would be a nice small pattern just the very thing for register stoves  so he spelt the bill through again from beginning to end and then touching his fur cap in token of humility accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat  this here boy sir wot the parish wants to prentis said mr gamfield  ay my man said the gentleman in the white waistcoat with a condescending smile  what of him  if the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade in a good spectable chimbleysweepin bisness said mr gamfield i wants a prentis and i am ready to take him  walk in said the gentleman in the white waistcoat  mr gamfield having lingered behind to give the donkey another blow on the head and another wrench of the jaw as a caution not to run away in his absence followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where oliver had first seen him  its a nasty trade said mr limbkins when gamfield had again stated his wish  young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now said another gentleman  thats acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to make em come down again said gamfield thats all smoke and no blaze vereas smoke aint o no use at all in making a boy come down for it only sinds him to sleep and thats wot he likes  boys is wery obstinit and wery lazy genlmen and theres nothink like a good hot blaze to make em come down vith a run  its humane too genlmen acause even if theyve stuck in the chimbley roasting their feet makes em struggle to hextricate theirselves  the gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this explanation but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from mr limbkins  the board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few minutes but in so low a tone that the words saving of expenditure looked well in the accounts have a printed report published were alone audible  these only chanced to be heard indeed or account of their being very frequently repeated with great emphasis  at length the whispering ceased and the members of the board having resumed their seats and their solemnity mr limbkins said  we have considered your proposition and we dont approve of it  not at all said the gentleman in the white waistcoat  decidedly not added the other members  as mr gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having bruised three or four boys to death already it occurred to him that the board had perhaps in some unaccountable freak taken it into their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings it was very unlike their general mode of doing business if they had but still as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour he twisted his cap in his hands and walked slowly from the table  so you wont let me have him genlmen said mr gamfield pausing near the door  no replied mr limbkins at least as its a nasty business we think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered  mr gamfields countenance brightened as with a quick step he returned to the table and said  whatll you give genlmen  come  dont be too hard on a poor man whatll you give  i should say three pound ten was plenty said mr limbkins  ten shillings too much said the gentleman in the white waistcoat  come said gamfield say four pound genlmen  say four pound and youve got rid of him for good and all  there  three pound ten repeated mr limbkins firmly  come  ill split the difference genlmen urged gamfield three pound fifteen  not a farthing more was the firm reply of mr limbkins  youre desperate hard upon me genlmen said gamfield wavering  pooh  pooh  nonsense said the gentleman in the white waistcoat hed be cheap with nothing at all as a premium take him you silly fellow  hes just the boy for you  he wants the stick now and then itll do him good and his board neednt come very expensive for he hasnt been overfed since he was born  ha  ha  ha  mr gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table and observing a smile on all of them gradually broke into a smile himself the bargain was made  mr bumble was at once instructed that oliver twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate for signature and approval that very afternoon  in pursuance of this determination little oliver to his excessive astonishment was released from bondage and ordered to put himself into a clean shirt  he had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic performance when mr bumble brought him with his own hands a basin of gruel and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread at this tremendous sight oliver began to cry very piteously thinking not unnaturally that the board must have determined to kill him for some useful purpose or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that way  dont make your eyes red oliver but eat your food and be thankful said mr bumble in a tone of impressive pomposity youre a going to be made a prentice of oliver  a prentice sir said the child trembling  yes oliver said mr bumble  the kind and blessed gentleman which is so many parents to you oliver when you have none of your own are a going to prentice you and to set you up in life and make a man of you although the expense to the parish is three pound tenthree pound ten oliverseventy shillinsone hundred and forty sixpencesand all for a naughty orphan which nobody cant love  as mr bumble paused to take breath after delivering this address in an awful voice the tears rolled down the poor childs face and he sobbed bitterly  come said mr bumble somewhat less pompously for it was gratifying to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced come oliver  wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket and dont cry into your gruel thats a very foolish action oliver  it certainly was for there was quite enough water in it already  on their way to the magistrate mr bumble instructed oliver that all he would have to do would be to look very happy and say when the gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed that he should like it very much indeed both of which injunctions oliver promised to obey the rather as mr bumble threw in a gentle hint that if he failed in either particular there was no telling what would be done to him when they arrived at the office he was shut up in a little room by himself and admonished by mr bumble to stay there until he came back to fetch him  there the boy remained with a palpitating heart for half an hour  at the expiration of which time mr bumble thrust in his head unadorned with the cocked hat and said aloud  now oliver my dear come to the gentleman  as mr bumble said this he put on a grim and threatening look and added in a low voice mind what i told you you young rascal  oliver stared innocently in mr bumbles face at this somewhat contradictory style of address but that gentleman prevented his offering any remark thereupon by leading him at once into an adjoining room the door of which was open it was a large room with a great window  behind a desk sat two old gentleman with powdered heads one of whom was reading the newspaper while the other was perusing with the aid of a pair of tortoiseshell spectacles a small piece of parchment which lay before him  mr limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side and mr gamfield with a partially washed face on the other while two or three blufflooking men in topboots were lounging about  the old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off over the little bit of parchment and there was a short pause after oliver had been stationed by mr bumble in front of the desk  this is the boy your worship said mr bumble  the old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a moment and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve whereupon the lastmentioned old gentleman woke up  oh is this the boy said the old gentleman  this is him sir replied mr bumble  bow to the magistrate my dear  oliver roused himself and made his best obeisance  he had been wondering with his eyes fixed on the magistrates powder whether all boards were born with that white stuff on their heads and were boards from thenceforth on that account  well said the old gentleman i suppose hes fond of chimneysweeping  he doats on it your worship replied bumble giving oliver a sly pinch to intimate that he had better not say he didnt  and he will be a sweep will he inquired the old gentleman  if we was to bind him to any other trade tomorrow hed run away simultaneous your worship replied bumble  and this man thats to be his masteryou siryoull treat him well and feed him and do all that sort of thing will you said the old gentleman  when i says i will i means i will replied mr gamfield doggedly  youre a rough speaker my friend but you look an honest openhearted man said the old gentleman turning his spectacles in the direction of the candidate for olivers premium whose villainous countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty  but the magistrate was half blind and half childish so he couldnt reasonably be expected to discern what other people did  i hope i am sir said mr gamfield with an ugly leer  i have no doubt you are my friend replied the old gentleman fixing his spectacles more firmly on his nose and looking about him for the inkstand  it was the critical moment of olivers fate  if the inkstand had been where the old gentleman thought it was he would have dipped his pen into it and signed the indentures and oliver would have been straightway hurried off  but as it chanced to be immediately under his nose it followed as a matter of course that he looked all over his desk for it without finding it and happening in the course of his search to look straight before him his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of oliver twist who despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of bumble was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master with a mingled expression of horror and fear too palpable to be mistaken even by a halfblind magistrate  the old gentleman stopped laid down his pen and looked from oliver to mr limbkins who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned aspect  my boy said the old gentleman you look pale and alarmed what is the matter  stand a little away from him beadle said the other magistrate laying aside the paper and leaning forward with an expression of interest  now boy tell us whats the matter dont be afraid  oliver fell on his knees and clasping his hands together prayed that they would order him back to the dark roomthat they would starve himbeat himkill him if they pleasedrather than send him away with that dreadful man  well said mr bumble raising his hands and eyes with most impressive solemnity  well of all the artful and designing orphans that ever i see oliver you are one of the most barefacedest  hold your tongue beadle said the second old gentleman when mr bumble had given vent to this compound adjective  i beg your worships pardon said mr bumble incredulous of having heard aright  did your worship speak to me  yes  hold your tongue  mr bumble was stupefied with astonishment  a beadle ordered to hold his tongue  a moral revolution  the old gentleman in the tortoiseshell spectacles looked at his companion he nodded significantly  we refuse to sanction these indentures said the old gentleman tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke  i hope stammered mr limbkins  i hope the magistrates will not form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct on the unsupported testimony of a child  the magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the matter said the second old gentleman sharply  take the boy back to the workhouse and treat him kindly  he seems to want it  that same evening the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively and decidedly affirmed not only that oliver would be hung but that he would be drawn and quartered into the bargain mr bumble shook his head with gloomy mystery and said he wished he might come to good whereunto mr gamfield replied that he wished he might come to him which although he agreed with the beadle in most matters would seem to be a wish of a totally opposite description  the next morning the public were once informed that oliver twist was again to let and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take possession of him
