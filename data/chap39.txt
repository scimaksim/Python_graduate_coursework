chapter xxxvii  in which the reader may perceive a contrast not uncommon in matrimonial cases  mr bumble sat in the workhouse parlour with his eyes moodily fixed on the cheerless grate whence as it was summer time no brighter gleam proceeded than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun which were sent back from its cold and shining surface  a paper flycage dangled from the ceiling to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy thought and as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy network mr bumble would heave a deep sigh while a more gloomy shadow overspread his countenance  mr bumble was meditating it might be that the insects brought to mind some painful passage in his own past life  nor was mr bumbles gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator there were not wanting other appearances and those closely connected with his own person which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his affairs  the laced coat and the cocked hat where were they  he still wore kneebreeches and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs but they were not the breeches  the coat was wideskirted and in that respect like the coat but oh how different  the mighty cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one  mr bumble was no longer a beadle  there are some promotions in life which independent of the more substantial rewards they offer require peculiar value and dignity from the coats and waistcoats connected with them  a fieldmarshal has his uniform a bishop his silk apron a counsellor his silk gown a beadle his cocked hat  strip the bishop of his apron or the beadle of his hat and lace what are they  men  mere men  dignity and even holiness too sometimes are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people imagine  mr bumble had married mrs corney and was master of the workhouse another beadle had come into power  on him the cocked hat goldlaced coat and staff had all three descended  and tomorrow two months it was done said mr bumble with a sigh it seems a age  mr bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of happiness into the short space of eight weeks but the sighthere was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh  i sold myself said mr bumble pursuing the same train of relection for six teaspoons a pair of sugartongs and a milkpot with a small quantity of secondhand furniture and twenty pound in money  i went very reasonable  cheap dirt cheap  cheap cried a shrill voice in mr bumbles ear you would have been dear at any price and dear enough i paid for you lord above knows that  mr bumble turned and encountered the face of his interesting consort who imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his complaint had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture  mrs bumble maam said mr bumble with a sentimental sternness  well cried the lady  have the goodness to look at me said mr bumble fixing his eyes upon her  if she stands such a eye as that said mr bumble to himself she can stand anything  it is a eye i never knew to fail with paupers  if it fails with her my power is gone  whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell paupers who being lightly fed are in no very high condition or whether the late mrs corney was particularly proof against eagle glances are matters of opinion  the matter of fact is that the matron was in no way overpowered by mr bumbles scowl but on the contrary treated it with great disdain and even raised a laugh thereat which sounded as though it were genuine  on hearing this most unexpected sound mr bumble looked first incredulous and afterwards amazed  he then relapsed into his former state nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by the voice of his partner  are you going to sit snoring there all day inquired mrs bumble  i am going to sit here as long as i think proper maam rejoined mr bumble and although i was not snoring i shall snore gape sneeze laugh or cry as the humour strikes me such being my prerogative  your prerogative sneered mrs bumble with ineffable contempt  i said the word maam said mr bumble  the prerogative of a man is to command  and whats the prerogative of a woman in the name of goodness cried the relict of mr corney deceased  to obey maam thundered mr bumble  your late unfortunate husband should have taught it you and then perhaps he might have been alive now  i wish he was poor man  mrs bumble seeing at a glance that the decisive moment had now arrived and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other must necessarily be final and conclusive no sooner heard this allusion to the dead and gone than she dropped into a chair and with a loud scream that mr bumble was a hardhearted brute fell into a paroxysm of tears  but tears were not the things to find their way to mr bumbles soul his heart was waterproof  like washable beaver hats that improve with rain his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous by showers of tears which being tokens of weakness and so far tacit admissions of his own power pleased and exalted him  he eyed his good lady with looks of great satisfaction and begged in an encouraging manner that she should cry her hardest  the exercise being looked upon by the faculty as strongly conducive to health  it opens the lungs washes the countenance exercises the eyes and softens down the temper said mr bumble  so cry away  as he discharged himself of this pleasantry mr bumble took his hat from a peg and putting it on rather rakishly on one side as a man might who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner thrust his hands into his pockets and sauntered towards the door with much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance  now mrs corney that was had tried the tears because they were less troublesome than a manual assault but she was quite prepared to make trial of the latter mode of proceeding as mr bumble was not long in discovering  the first proof he experienced of the fact was conveyed in a hollow sound immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the opposite end of the room  this preliminary proceeding laying bare his head the expert lady clasping him tightly round the throat with one hand inflicted a shower of blows dealt with singular vigour and dexterity upon it with the other  this done she created a little variety by scratching his face and tearing his hair and having by this time inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence she pushed him over a chair which was luckily well situated for the purpose  and defied him to talk about his prerogative again if he dared  get up said mrs bumble in a voice of command  and take yourself away from here unless you want me to do something desperate  mr bumble rose with a very rueful countenance  wondering much what something desperate might be  picking up his hat he looked towards the door  are you going demanded mrs bumble  certainly my dear certainly rejoined mr bumble making a quicker motion towards the door  i didnt intend toim going my dear  you are so very violent that really i  at this instant mrs bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the carpet which had been kicked up in the scuffle  mr bumble immediately darted out of the room without bestowing another thought on his unfinished sentence  leaving the late mrs corney in full possession of the field  mr bumble was fairly taken by surprise and fairly beaten  he had a decided propensity for bullying  derived no inconsiderable pleasure from the exercise of petty cruelty and consequently was it is needless to say a coward  this is by no means a disparagement to his character for many official personages who are held in high respect and admiration are the victims of similar infirmities  the remark is made indeed rather in his favour than otherwise and with a view of impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for office  but the measure of his degradation was not yet full  after making a tour of the house and thinking for the first time that the poorlaws really were too hard on people and that men who ran away from their wives leaving them chargeable to the parish ought in justice to be visited with no punishment at all but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals who had suffered much mr bumble came to a room where some of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen  when the sound of voices in conversation now proceeded  hem said mr bumble summoning up all his native dignity these women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative hallo hallo there  what do you mean by this noise you hussies  with these words mr bumble opened the door and walked in with a very fierce and angry manner  which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated and cowering air as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady wife  my dear said mr bumble i didnt know you were here  didnt know i was here repeated mrs bumble  what do you do here  i thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work properly my dear replied mr bumble  glancing distractedly at a couple of old women at the washtub who were comparing notes of admiration at the workhousemasters humility  you thought they were talking too much said mrs bumble what business is it of yours  why my dear urged mr bumble submissively  what business is it of yours demanded mrs bumble again  its very true youre matron here my dear submitted mr bumble but i thought you mightnt be in the way just then  ill tell you what mr bumble returned his lady  we dont want any of your interference  youre a great deal too fond of poking your nose into things that dont concern you making everybody in the house laugh the moment your back is turned and making yourself look like a fool every hour in the day  be off come  mr bumble seeing with excruciating feelings the delight of the two old paupers who were tittering together most rapturously hesitated for an instant  mrs bumble whose patience brooked no delay caught up a bowl of soapsuds and motioning him towards the door ordered him instantly to depart on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person  what could mr bumble do  he looked dejectedly round and slunk away and as he reached the door the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight  it wanted but this  he was degraded in their eyes he had lost caste and station before the very paupers he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship to the lowest depth of the most snubbed henpeckery  all in two months said mr bumble filled with dismal thoughts two months  no more than two months ago i was not only my own master but everybody elses so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned and now  it was too much  mr bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate for him for he had reached the portal in his reverie and walked distractedly into the street  he walked up one street and down another until exercise had abated the first passion of his grief and then the revulsion of feeling made him thirsty  he passed a great many publichouses but at length paused before one in a byway whose parlour as he gathered from a hasty peep over the blinds was deserted save by one solitary customer  it began to rain heavily at the moment  this determined him  mr bumble stepped in and ordering something to drink as he passed the bar entered the apartment into which he had looked from the street  the man who was seated there was tall and dark and wore a large cloak  he had the air of a stranger and seemed by a certain haggardness in his look as well as by the dusty soils on his dress to have travelled some distance  he eyed bumble askance as he entered but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation  mr bumble had quite dignity enough for two supposing even that the stranger had been more familiar  so he drank his ginandwater in silence and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance  it so happened however as it will happen very often when men fall into company under such circumstances  that mr bumble felt every now and then a powerful inducement which he could not resist to steal a look at the stranger  and that whenever he did so he withdrew his eyes in some confusion to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at him  mr bumbles awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable expression of the strangers eye which was keen and bright but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion unlike anything he had ever observed before and repulsive to behold  when they had encountered each others glance several times in this way the stranger in a harsh deep voice broke silence  were you looking for me he said when you peered in at the window  not that i am aware of unless youre mr  here mr bumble stopped short for he was curious to know the strangers name and thought in his impatience he might supply the blank  i see you were not said the stranger an expression of quiet sarcasm playing about his mouth or you have known my name  you dont know it  i would recommend you not to ask for it  i meant no harm young man observed mr bumble majestically  and have done none said the stranger  another silence succeeded this short dialogue  which was again broken by the stranger  i have seen you before i think said he  you were differently dressed at that time and i only passed you in the street but i should know you again  you were beadle here once were you not  i was said mr bumble in some surprise porochial beadle  just so rejoined the other nodding his head  it was in that character i saw you  what are you now  master of the workhouse rejoined mr bumble slowly and impressively to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume  master of the workhouse young man  you have the same eye to your own interest that you always had i doubt not resumed the stranger looking keenly into mr bumbles eyes as he raised them in astonishment at the question  dont scruple to answer freely man  i know you pretty well you see  i suppose a married man replied mr bumble shading his eyes with his hand and surveying the stranger from head to foot in evident perplexity is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can than a single one  porochial officers are not so well paid that they can afford to refuse any little extra fee when it comes to them in a civil and proper manner  the stranger smiled and nodded his head again as much to say he had not mistaken his man then rang the bell  fill this glass again he said handing mr bumbles empty tumbler to the landlord  let it be strong and hot  you like it so i suppose  not too strong replied mr bumble with a delicate cough  you understand what that means landlord said the stranger drily  the host smiled disappeared and shortly afterwards returned with a steaming jorum of which the first gulp brought the water into mr bumbles eyes  now listen to me said the stranger after closing the door and window  i came down to this place today to find you out and by one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes you walked into the very room i was sitting in while you were uppermost in my mind  i want some information from you  i dont ask you to give it for nothing slight as it is  put up that to begin with  as he spoke he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his companion carefully as though unwilling that the chinking of money should be heard without  when mr bumble had scrupulously examined the coins to see that they were genuine and had put them up with much satisfaction in his waistcoatpocket he went on  carry your memory backlet me seetwelve years last winter  its a long time said mr bumble  very good  ive done it  the scene the workhouse  good  and the time night  yes  and the place the crazy hole wherever it was in which miserable drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselvesgave birth to puling children for the parish to rear and hid their shame rot em in the grave  the lyingin room i suppose said mr bumble not quite following the strangers excited description  yes said the stranger  a boy was born there  a many boys observed mr bumble shaking his head despondingly  a murrain on the young devils cried the stranger i speak of one a meeklooking palefaced boy who was apprenticed down here to a coffinmakeri wish he had made his coffin and screwed his body in itand who afterwards ran away to london as it was supposed  why you mean oliver  young twist said mr bumble i remember him of course  there wasnt a obstinater young rascal  its not of him i want to hear ive heard enough of him said the stranger stopping mr bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of poor olivers vices  its of a woman the hag that nursed his mother  where is she  where is she said mr bumble whom the ginandwater had rendered facetious  it would be hard to tell  theres no midwifery there whichever place shes gone to so i suppose shes out of employment anyway  what do you mean demanded the stranger sternly  that she died last winter rejoined mr bumble  the man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information and although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards his gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted and he seemed lost in thought  for some time he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or disappointed by the intelligence but at length he breathed more freely and withdrawing his eyes observed that it was no great matter with that he rose as if to depart  but mr bumble was cunning enough and he at once saw that an opportunity was opened for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of his better half  he well remembered the night of old sallys death which the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect as the occasion on which he had proposed to mrs corney and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the solitary witness he had heard enough to know that it related to something that had occurred in the old womans attendance as workhouse nurse upon the young mother of oliver twist hastily calling this circumstance to mind he informed the stranger with an air of mystery that one woman had been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died and that she could as he had reason to believe throw some light on the subject of his inquiry  how can i find her said the stranger thrown off his guard and plainly showing that all his fears whatever they were were aroused afresh by the intelligence  only through me rejoined mr bumble  when cried the stranger hastily  tomorrow rejoined bumble  at nine in the evening said the stranger producing a scrap of paper and writing down upon it an obscure address by the waterside in characters that betrayed his agitation at nine in the evening bring her to me there  i neednt tell you to be secret  its your interest  with these words he led the way to the door after stopping to pay for the liquor that had been drunk  shortly remarking that their roads were different he departed without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night  on glancing at the address the parochial functionary observed that it contained no name  the stranger had not gone far so he made after him to ask it  what do you want cried the man turning quickly round as bumble touched him on the arm  following me  only to ask a question said the other pointing to the scrap of paper  what name am i to ask for  monks rejoined the man and strode hastily away
