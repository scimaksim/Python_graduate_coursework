chapter xxxii  of the happy life oliver began to lead with his kind friends  olivers ailings were neither slight nor few  in addition to the pain and delay attendant on a broken limb his exposure to the wet and cold had brought on fever and ague  which hung about him for many weeks and reduced him sadly but at length he began by slow degrees to get better and to be able to say sometimes in a few tearful words how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies and how ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again he could do something to show his gratitude only something which would let them see the love and duty with which his breast was full something however slight which would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away but that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery or death was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul  poor fellow said rose when oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips you shall have many opportunities of serving us if you will we are going into the country and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us  the quiet place the pure air and all the pleasure and beauties of spring will restore you in a few days  we will employ you in a hundred ways when you can bear the trouble  the trouble cried oliver  oh dear lady if i could but work for you if i could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers or watching your birds or running up and down the whole day long to make you happy what would i give to do it  you shall give nothing at all said miss maylie smiling for as i told you before we shall employ you in a hundred ways and if you only take half the trouble to please us that you promise now you will make me very happy indeed  happy maam cried oliver how kind of you to say so  you will make me happier than i can tell you replied the young lady to think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing any one from such sad misery as you have described to us would be an unspeakable pleasure to me but to know that the object of her goodness and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached in consequence would delight me more than you can well imagine  do you understand me she inquired watching olivers thoughtful face  oh yes maam yes replied oliver eagerly but i was thinking that i am ungrateful now  to whom inquired the young lady  to the kind gentleman and the dear old nurse who took so much care of me before rejoined oliver  if they knew how happy i am they would be pleased i am sure  i am sure they would rejoined olivers benefactress and mr losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to bear the journey he will carry you to see them  has he maam cried oliver his face brightening with pleasure  i dont know what i shall do for joy when i see their kind faces once again  in a short time oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue of this expedition  one morning he and mr losberne set out accordingly in a little carriage which belonged to mrs maylie  when they came to chertsey bridge oliver turned very pale and uttered a loud exclamation  whats the matter with the boy cried the doctor as usual all in a bustle  do you see anythinghear anythingfeel anythingeh  that sir cried oliver pointing out of the carriage window that house  yes well what of it  stop coachman  pull up here cried the doctor  what of the house my man eh  the thievesthe house they took me to whispered oliver  the devil it is cried the doctor  hallo there let me out  but before the coachman could dismount from his box he had tumbled out of the coach by some means or other and running down to the deserted tenement began kicking at the door like a madman  halloa said a little ugly humpbacked man  opening the door so suddenly that the doctor from the very impetus of his last kick nearly fell forward into the passage whats the matter here  matter exclaimed the other collaring him without a moments reflection  a good deal  robbery is the matter  therell be murder the matter too replied the humpbacked man coolly if you dont take your hands off  do you hear me  i hear you said the doctor giving his captive a hearty shake  wheresconfound the fellow whats his rascally namesikes thats it  wheres sikes you thief  the humpbacked man stared as if in excess of amazement and indignation then twisting himself dexterously from the doctors grasp growled forth a volley of horrid oaths and retired into the house  before he could shut the door however the doctor had passed into the parlour without a word of parley  he looked anxiously round not an article of furniture not a vestige of anything animate or inanimate not even the position of the cupboards answered olivers description  now said the humpbacked man who had watched him keenly what do you mean by coming into my house in this violent way do you want to rob me or to murder me  which is it  did you ever know a man come out to do either in a chariot and pair you ridiculous old vampire said the irritable doctor  what do you want then demanded the hunchback  will you take yourself off before i do you a mischief  curse you  as soon as i think proper said mr losberne looking into the other parlour which like the first bore no resemblance whatever to olivers account of it  i shall find you out some day my friend  will you sneered the illfavoured cripple  if you ever want me im here  i havent lived here mad and all alone for fiveandtwenty years to be scared by you  you shall pay for this you shall pay for this  and so saying the misshapen little demon set up a yell and danced upon the ground as if wild with rage  stupid enough this muttered the doctor to himself the boy must have made a mistake  here  put that in your pocket and shut yourself up again  with these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money and returned to the carriage  the man followed to the chariot door uttering the wildest imprecations and curses all the way but as mr losberne turned to speak to the driver he looked into the carriage and eyed oliver for an instant with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive that waking or sleeping he could not forget it for months afterwards  he continued to utter the most fearful imprecations until the driver had resumed his seat and when they were once more on their way they could see him some distance behind beating his feet upon the ground and tearing his hair in transports of real or pretended rage  i am an ass said the doctor after a long silence  did you know that before oliver  no sir  then dont forget it another time  an ass said the doctor again after a further silence of some minutes  even if it had been the right place and the right fellows had been there what could i have done singlehanded and if i had had assistance i see no good that i should have done except leading to my own exposure and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which i have hushed up this business that would have served me right though i am always involving myself in some scrape or other by acting on impulse  it might have done me good  now the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything but impulse all through his life and it was no bad compliment to the nature of the impulses which governed him that so far from being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes he had the warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him  if the truth must be told he was a little out of temper for a minute or two at being disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of olivers story on the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any  he soon came round again however and finding that olivers replies to his questions were still as straightforward and consistent and still delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth as they had ever been he made up his mind to attach full credence to them from that time forth  as oliver knew the name of the street in which mr brownlow resided they were enabled to drive straight thither  when the coach turned into it his heart beat so violently that he could scarcely draw his breath  now my boy which house is it inquired mr losberne  that  that replied oliver pointing eagerly out of the window the white house  oh make haste  pray make haste i feel as if i should die it makes me tremble so  come come said the good doctor patting him on the shoulder you will see them directly and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well  oh  i hope so cried oliver  they were so good to me so very very good to me  the coach rolled on  it stopped  no that was the wrong house the next door  it went on a few paces and stopped again oliver looked up at the windows with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face  alas the white house was empty and there was a bill in the window to let  knock at the next door cried mr losberne taking olivers arm in his  what has become of mr brownlow who used to live in the adjoining house do you know  the servant did not know but would go and inquire  she presently returned and said that mr brownlow had sold off his goods and gone to the west indies six weeks before  oliver clasped his hands and sank feebly backward  has his housekeeper gone too inquired mr losberne after a moments pause  yes sir replied the servant  the old gentleman the housekeeper and a gentleman who was a friend of mr brownlows all went together  then turn towards home again said mr losberne to the driver and dont stop to bait the horses till you get out of this confounded london  the bookstall keeper sir said oliver  i know the way there  see him pray sir  do see him  my poor boy this is disappointment enough for one day said the doctor  quite enough for both of us  if we go to the bookstall keepers we shall certainly find that he is dead or has set his house on fire or run away  no home again straight  and in obedience to the doctors impulse home they went  this bitter disappointment caused oliver much sorrow and grief even in the midst of his happiness for he had pleased himself many times during his illness with thinking of all that mr brownlow and mrs bedwin would say to him and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him and in bewailing his cruel separation from them the hope of eventually clearing himself with them too and explaining how he had been forced away had buoyed him up and sustained him under many of his recent trials and now the idea that they should have gone so far and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robbera belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying daywas almost more than he could bear  the circumstance occasioned no alteration however in the behaviour of his benefactors  after another fortnight when the fine warm weather had fairly begun and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves and rich blossoms they made preparations for quitting the house at chertsey for some months  sending the plate which had so excited fagins cupidity to the bankers and leaving giles and another servant in care of the house they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country and took oliver with them  who can describe the pleasure and delight the peace of mind and soft tranquillity the sickly boy felt in the balmy air and among the green hills and rich woods of an inland village  who can tell how scenes of peace and quietude sink into the minds of painworn dwellers in close and noisy places and carry their own freshness deep into their jaded hearts  men who have lived in crowded pentup streets through lives of toil and who have never wished for change men to whom custom has indeed been second nature and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks even they with the hand of death upon them have been known to yearn at last for one short glimpse of natures face and carried far from the scenes of their old pains and pleasures have seemed to pass at once into a new state of being  crawling forth from day to day to some green sunny spot they have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky and hill and plain and glistening water that a foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline and they have sunk into their tombs as peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before faded from their dim and feeble sight  the memories which peaceful country scenes call up are not of this world nor of its thoughts and hopes their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved  may purify our thoughts and bear down before it old enmity and hatred but beneath all this there lingers in the least reflective mind a vague and halfformed consciousness of having held such feelings long before in some remote and distant time which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come and bends down pride and worldliness beneath it  it was a lovely spot to which they repaired  oliver whose days had been spent among squalid crowds and in the midst of noise and brawling seemed to enter on a new existence there  the rose and honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees and the gardenflowers perfumed the air with delicious odours  hard by was a little churchyard not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones but full of humble mounds covered with fresh turf and moss beneath which the old people of the village lay at rest  oliver often wandered here and thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen but when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground and would weep for her sadly but without pain  it was a happy time  the days were peaceful and serene the nights brought with them neither fear nor care no languishing in a wretched prison or associating with wretched men nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts  every morning he went to a whiteheaded old gentleman who lived near the little church who taught him to read better and to write  and who spoke so kindly and took such pains that oliver could never try enough to please him  then he would walk with mrs maylie and rose and hear them talk of books or perhaps sit near them in some shady place and listen whilst the young lady read which he could have done until it grew too dark to see the letters then he had his own lesson for the next day to prepare and at this he would work hard in a little room which looked into the garden till evening came slowly on when the ladies would walk out again and he with them listening with such pleasure to all they said  and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch that he could never be quick enough about it when it became quite dark and they returned home the young lady would sit down to the piano and play some pleasant air or sing in a low and gentle voice some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear there would be no candles lighted at such times as these and oliver would sit by one of the windows listening to the sweet music in a perfect rapture  and when sunday came how differently the day was spent from any way in which he had ever spent it yet and how happily too like all the other days in that most happy time  there was the little church in the morning with the green leaves fluttering at the windows  the birds singing without  and the sweetsmelling air stealing in at the low porch and filling the homely building with its fragrance the poor people were so neat and clean and knelt so reverently in prayer that it seemed a pleasure not a tedious duty their assembling there together and though the singing might be rude it was real and sounded more musical to olivers ears at least than any he had ever heard in church before  then there were the walks as usual and many calls at the clean houses of the labouring men and at night oliver read a chapter or two from the bible which he had been studying all the week and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and pleased than if he had been the clergyman himself  in the morning oliver would be afoot by six oclock roaming the fields and plundering the hedges far and wide for nosegays of wild flowers with which he would return laden home and which it took great care and consideration to arrange to the best advantage for the embellishment of the breakfasttable there was fresh groundsel too for miss maylies birds with which oliver who had been studying the subject under the able tuition of the village clerk would decorate the cages in the most approved taste when the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the village or failing that there was rare cricketplaying sometimes on the green or failing that there was always something to do in the garden or about the plants to which oliver who had studied this science also under the same master who was a gardener by trade applied himself with hearty goodwill until miss rose made her appearance  when there were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done  so three months glided away three months which in the life of the most blessed and favoured of mortals might have been unmingled happiness and which in olivers were true felicity with the purest and most amiable generosity on one side and the truest warmest soulfelt gratitude on the other it is no wonder that by the end of that short time oliver twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart was repaid by their pride in and attachment to himself
