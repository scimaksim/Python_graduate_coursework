chapter xlvii  fatal consequences  it was nearly two hours before daybreak that time which in the autumn of the year may be truly called the dead of night when the streets are silent and deserted when even sounds appear to slumber and profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream it was at this still and silent hour that fagin sat watching in his old lair with face so distorted and pale and eyes so red and bloodshot that he looked less like a man than like some hideous phantom moist from the grave and worried by an evil spirit  he sat crouching over a cold hearth wrapped in an old torn coverlet with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his side  his right hand was raised to his lips and as absorbed in thought he hit his long black nails he disclosed among his toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dogs or rats  stretched upon a mattress on the floor lay noah claypole fast asleep towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant and then brought them back again to the candle which with a longburnt wick drooping almost double and hot grease falling down in clots upon the table plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere  indeed they were  mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers and utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up bitter disappointment at the loss of his revenge on sikes the fear of detection and ruin and death and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all these were the passionate considerations which following close upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl shot through the brain of fagin as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart  he sat without changing his attitude in the least or appearing to take the smallest heed of time until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a footstep in the street  at last he muttered wiping his dry and fevered mouth at last  the bell rang gently as he spoke  he crept upstairs to the door and presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin who carried a bundle under one arm sitting down and throwing back his outer coat the man displayed the burly frame of sikes  there he said laying the bundle on the table  take care of that and do the most you can with it  its been trouble enough to get i thought i should have been here three hours ago  fagin laid his hand upon the bundle and locking it in the cupboard sat down again without speaking  but he did not take his eyes off the robber for an instant during this action and now that they sat over against each other face to face he looked fixedly at him with his lips quivering so violently and his face so altered by the emotions which had mastered him that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair and surveyed him with a look of real affright  wot now cried sikes  wot do you look at a man so for  fagin raised his right hand and shook his trembling forefinger in the air but his passion was so great that the power of speech was for the moment gone  damme said sikes feeling in his breast with a look of alarm hes gone mad  i must look to myself here  no no rejoined fagin finding his voice  its notyoure not the person bill  ive nono fault to find with you  oh you havent havent you said sikes looking sternly at him and ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket  thats luckyfor one of us  which one that is dont matter  ive got that to tell you bill said fagin drawing his chair nearer will make you worse than me  aye returned the robber with an incredulous air  tell away look sharp or nance will think im lost  lost cried fagin  she has pretty well settled that in her own mind already  sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the jews face and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there clenched his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly  speak will you he said or if you dont it shall be for want of breath  open your mouth and say wot youve got to say in plain words out with it you thundering old cur out with it  suppose that lad thats laying there fagin began  sikes turned round to where noah was sleeping as if he had not previously observed him  well he said resuming his former position  suppose that lad pursued fagin was to peachto blow upon us allfirst seeking out the right folks for the purpose and then having a meeting with em in the street to paint our likenesses describe every mark that they might know us by and the crib where we might be most easily taken  suppose he was to do all this and besides to blow upon a plant weve all been in more or lessof his own fancy not grabbed trapped tried earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and waterbut of his own fancy to please his own taste stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us and peaching to them  do you hear me cried the jew his eyes flashing with rage  suppose he did all this what then  what then replied sikes with a tremendous oath  if he was left alive till i came id grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head  what if i did it cried fagin almost in a yell  i that knows so much and could hang so many besides myself  i dont know replied sikes clenching his teeth and turning white at the mere suggestion  id do something in the jail that ud get me put in irons and if i was tried along with you id fall upon you with them in the open court and beat your brains out afore the people i should have such strength muttered the robber poising his brawny arm that i could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it  you would  would i said the housebreaker  try me  if it was charley or the dodger or bet or  i dont care who replied sikes impatiently  whoever it was id serve them the same  fagin looked hard at the robber and motioning him to be silent stooped over the bed upon the floor and shook the sleeper to rouse him  sikes leant forward in his chair  looking on with his hands upon his knees as if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in  bolter bolter  poor lad said fagin looking up with an expression of devilish anticipation and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis hes tiredtired with watching for her so longwatching for her bill  wot dye mean asked sikes drawing back  fagin made no answer but bending over the sleeper again hauled him into a sitting posture  when his assumed name had been repeated several times noah rubbed his eyes and giving a heavy yawn looked sleepily about him  tell me that againonce again just for him to hear said the jew pointing to sikes as he spoke  tell yer what asked the sleepy noah shaking himself pettishly  that about nancy said fagin clutching sikes by the wrist as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough you followed her  yes  to london bridge  yes  where she met two people  so she did  a gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before who asked her to give up all her pals and monks first which she didand to describe him which she didand to tell her what house it was that we meet at and go to which she didand where it could be best watched from which she didand what time the people went there which she did  she did all this  she told it all every word without a threat without a murmurshe diddid she not cried fagin half mad with fury  all right replied noah scratching his head  thats just what it was  what did they say about last sunday  about last sunday replied noah considering  why i told yer that before  again  tell it again cried fagin tightening his grasp on sikes and brandishing his other hand aloft as the foam flew from his lips  they asked her said noah who as he grew more wakeful seemed to have a dawning perception who sikes was they asked her why she didnt come last sunday as she promised  she said she couldnt  whywhy  tell him that  because she was forcibly kept at home by bill the man she had told them of before replied noah  what more of him cried fagin  what more of the man she had told them of before  tell him that tell him that  why that she couldnt very easily get out of doors unless he knew where she was going to said noah and so the first time she went to see the lady sheha ha ha it made me laugh when she said it that it didshe gave him a drink of laudanum  hells fire cried sikes breaking fiercely from the jew  let me go  flinging the old man from him he rushed from the room and darted wildly and furiously up the stairs  bill bill cried fagin following him hastily  a word only a word  the word would not have been exchanged but that the housebreaker was unable to open the door  on which he was expending fruitless oaths and violence when the jew came panting up  let me out said sikes  dont speak to me its not safe let me out i say  hear me speak a word rejoined fagin laying his hand upon the lock you wont be  well replied the other  you wont betooviolent bill  the day was breaking and there was light enough for the men to see each others faces  they exchanged one brief glance there was a fire in the eyes of both which could not be mistaken  i mean said fagin showing that he felt all disguise was now useless not too violent for safety  be crafty bill and not too bold  sikes made no reply but pulling open the door of which fagin had turned the lock dashed into the silent streets  without one pause or moments consideration without once turning his head to the right or left or raising his eyes to the sky or lowering them to the ground but looking straight before him with savage resolution  his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed starting through his skin the robber held on his headlong course nor muttered a word nor relaxed a muscle until he reached his own door  he opened it softly with a key strode lightly up the stairs and entering his own room doublelocked the door and lifting a heavy table against it drew back the curtain of the bed  the girl was lying halfdressed upon it  he had roused her from her sleep for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look  get up said the man  it is you bill said the girl with an expression of pleasure at his return  it is was the reply  get up  there was a candle burning but the man hastily drew it from the candlestick and hurled it under the grate  seeing the faint light of early day without the girl rose to undraw the curtain  let it be said sikes thrusting his hand before her theres enough light for wot ive got to do  bill said the girl in the low voice of alarm why do you look like that at me  the robber sat regarding her for a few seconds with dilated nostrils and heaving breast and then grasping her by the head and throat dragged her into the middle of the room and looking once towards the door placed his heavy hand upon her mouth  bill bill gasped the girl wrestling with the strength of mortal fearii wont scream or crynot oncehear mespeak to metell me what i have done  you know you she devil returned the robber suppressing his breath you were watched tonight every word you said was heard  then spare my life for the love of heaven as i spared yours rejoined the girl clinging to him  bill dear bill you cannot have the heart to kill me  oh think of all i have given up only this one night for you  you shall have time to think and save yourself this crime i will not loose my hold you cannot throw me off  bill bill for dear gods sake for your own for mine stop before you spill my blood  i have been true to you upon my guilty soul i have  the man struggled violently to release his arms but those of the girl were clasped round his and tear her as he would he could not tear them away  bill cried the girl striving to lay her head upon his breast the gentleman and that dear lady told me tonight of a home in some foreign country where i could end my days in solitude and peace  let me see them again and beg them on my knees to show the same mercy and goodness to you and let us both leave this dreadful place and far apart lead better lives and forget how we have lived except in prayers and never see each other more it is never too late to repent they told me soi feel it nowbut we must have timea little little time  the housebreaker freed one arm and grasped his pistol the certainty of immediate detection if he fired flashed across his mind even in the midst of his fury and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon upon the upturned face that almost touched his own  she staggered and fell  nearly blinded with the blood that rained down from a deep gash in her forehead but raising herself with difficulty on her knees drew from her bosom a white handkerchiefrose maylies ownand holding it up in her folded hands as high towards heaven as her feeble strength would allow breathed one prayer for mercy to her maker  it was a ghastly figure to look upon  the murderer staggering backward to the wall and shutting out the sight with his hand seized a heavy club and struck her down
